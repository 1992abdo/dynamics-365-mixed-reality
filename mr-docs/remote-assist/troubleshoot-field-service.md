If your organization uses Dynamics 365 for Field Service to manage field service work orders, 
the first-line worker can view Dynamics 365 for Field Service bookings from Remote Assist and 
quickly call the expert listed in the Support Contact field when needed. This enables first-line workers 
to do heads-up, hands-free calling through HoloLens in the context of a Dynamics 365 for Field Service booking.
