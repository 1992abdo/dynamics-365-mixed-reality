[This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile app extends the capabilities of Dynamics 365 Remote Assist to work with Android 
ARCore-capable phones (in addition to Microsoft HoloLens). Technicians can use their phones to connect and collaborate with an 
expert on Microsoft Teams. Using live video calling and mixed reality annotations, they can share what they see with the expert 
to troubleshoot problems together, faster. 

## What you’ll need

at least one plane   in your work area. You do this by scanning your work area with the phone. When a plane has been recognized, 
you’ll see a confirmation visualization and the annotation toolbar will appear at the top of the screen:
  
> [!NOTE]

recognizes the environment.
