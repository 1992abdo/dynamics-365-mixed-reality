# Deploy Dynamics 365 Remote Assist

After you acquire either the 30-day Dynamics 365 Remote Assist trial license, Dynamics 365 Remote Assist subscription, or Dynamics 365 Remote Assist Attach subscription for **HoloLens 1**, **HoloLens 2**, and **mobile device**, IT Admins can assign licenses to users in their organization and then users in their organization can deploy Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on their devices.

> [!NOTE]
> There are two users for D365 Remote Assist or D365 Remote Assist Attach: Field service technicians and Remote experts. Field service technicians require D365 Remote Assist or D365 Remote Assist Attach licenses **and** Microsoft Teams license. When you buy D365 Remote Assist or D365 Remote Assist Attach licenses, it includes Micrsoft Teams licenses. On the otherhand, experts require a Microsoft Teams license only. You can find out more information on how to deploy Microsoft Teams licenses for experts in your organization [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/mixed-reality/remote-assist/use-microsoft-teams-with-remote-assist).

In this topic, we’ll walk through the ways you can deploy Dynamics 365 Remote Assist or Dynamics 365 Remote Assist Attach (for D365 Field Service customers only):
