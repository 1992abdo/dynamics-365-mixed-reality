# Join a meeting from the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile app

A Microsoft Teams meeting is a meeting scheduled using Teams, involving any number of participants. Meetings are useful for maintenance and repairs that are scheduled in advance. It's also useful for inspections and other recurring scenarios.

> [!Note]
> If a remote collaborator joins a meeting, you will not receive a call or notification, regardless of whether you are in the app. You must select **Join Meeting** to join the meeting. In addition, calling the participants involved in a scheduled meeting will not enable you to join the meeting; you must actually join the meeting. 

If for some reason you're unable to join the meeting, you may also ask the Teams user to join the meeting and use the **Open Participants** feature to call you. You'll receive an incoming call notification. Accept the call, and you will join the meeting.

To join a meeting, select **Meeting** from the bottom of the main screen. Upcoming meetings within the next ten minutes are then displayed. Select **Join** next to the meeting to join that meeting.

After you join a meeting, Teams users can add more people to the meeting.
