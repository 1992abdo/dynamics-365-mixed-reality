# Send text messages in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens


You can send text messages with other call participants.
To open the chat window and enter a message:
*	Select Open Chat ![Text](media/RAHL_Text.png "Text") (or say “Remote Assist, Open Chat”).
*	Select the text preview field at the bottom of the chat window. This will bring up the holographic keyboard. Then, do one of the following:
  * Select characters in the holographic keyboard. You can directly tap each key.
  * Select Microphone, and then dictate your message. HoloLens will convert the message into text.
  * Connect a Bluetooth keyboard directly to the HoloLens and type your message.
  * Select Send 
* When the chat window is open, you can detach it from the video card by selecting Undock (or saying “Remote Assist, Undock).
* You can then place the chat window wherever you'd like.
 * If you are using HoloLens 1, use the slate controls found in the top right corner of the slate. 
 * If you are using HoloLens 2, grab the slate with one hand, move your hand to the desired location, and then release.
* To attach the text chat to the video card, select Redock  (or say “Remote Assist, Redock”).  * To close the chat window, select Open Chat ![Text](media/RAHL_Text.png "Text") (or say, “Remote Assist, Open Chat”).


To scroll up in the chat,  
* If you're using HoloLens 1 
 * TODO 
* If you're using HoloLens 2
 *	If the chat window is near you, scroll content by swiping on the surface of the content with your finger, just like you're using a touch screen.
 *	If the chat window is out of your reach, air tap and hold on the content and then move your hand ray up and down or side to side.
Note

> ![Note]
> If a message is sent from another user when the chat window isn’t open, a red dot will appear on the Show Chat button ![Test](media/RAHL_Text.png "Text"), but your chat window will not automatically open.


During a Remote Assist call, you will only see text messages and links to snapshots sent during the call. After a call ends, you can access the text messages and links via the chat log in Teams.
