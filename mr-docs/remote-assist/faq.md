# Dynamics 365 Remote Assist FAQ

Here are answers to common questions about using Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote
Assist.

For additional information, see [Get help with
HoloLens](https://support.microsoft.com/products/hololens).

If you’re an IT admin and you want to deploy Remote Assist to devices running
the HoloLens Commercial Suite, see [Buy and Deploy Remote Assist](../licensing/buy-and-deploy.md). 

**Can I still use the preview app?**

The preview period has ended. Existing preview app customers have until December
31, 2018, to upgrade to a paid subscription. 

**Can I try the app before buying it?**

Yes, Remote Assist is available as a free 30-day trial. For more information,
see [Buy and deploy Remote Assist](../licensing/buy-and-deploy.md).

**What are the technical requirements for installing Remote Assist?**

To use Remote Assist, you’ll need:

-   [A subscription to Dynamics 365 Remote Assist.](../licensing/buy-and-deploy.md)

-   A [HoloLens running the Windows 10 April 2018
    Update](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12643). 

-   A work or school account with an [Office 365
    Business](https://products.office.com/business/office) Premium or Essentials
    subscription.

-   A contact using the latest version of [Microsoft
    Teams](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) on a
    PC running Windows 10 to make a video call. Microsoft Teams is [available as
    a free download](https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads).

**Why am I not getting incoming call notifications?**

This can happen if you’re signed in to Remote Assist with a different account
than the one you used to sign in to your HoloLens. Make sure you’re signed in to
both the app and the device with the same account. 

**I see a message saying I have no internet connection.**

To use Remote Assist, you need a Wi-Fi connection. Make sure your HoloLens is
[connected to Wi-Fi](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12629).

**Remote Assist is frozen or unresponsive.**

Try closing and reopening Remote Assist. If you’re still having problems,
[restart your HoloLens](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12642).

**Remote Assist isn't showing my contacts.**

If you don’t see the contacts you expect, try the following:

-   Make sure you’ve signed in to Microsoft Teams at least once with the account
    you’re using on your HoloLens.

-   Close and reopen Remote Assist.

-   [Restart your HoloLens](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12642).

**The Mixed Reality toolbar doesn’t appear on the PC Teams client during a
Remote Assist call.**

This might happen if Teams has downloaded a new version of the client in the
background but is still running the older version of the app. Restarting your PC
will usually fix this issue.

**Why does audio sometimes cut out even in quiet environments?**

If Remote Assist is used in a loud environment, use headphones on both ends for
better communication. Using headphones for both users prevents any echo
filtering from proactively turning on noise cancellation, which turns off audio.

**Can I use Remote Assist to place a call between two separate tenants?**

Yes, but only if the expert is calling as a guest on the other user’s tenant.
Currently, Remote Assist doesn’t support two users calling each other even if
two tenants are joined by federation.

**Does Microsoft Teams include the same Remote Assist features on all platforms and devices?**

No. Ink, arrows, and adding files are only available on Teams for PC.

**I signed in to my HoloLens, but I still can't sign in to Remote Assist.**

If you’re having trouble signing in to Remote Assist, try the following:

-   Make sure you’re using a work or school account, not a Microsoft account, to
    sign in to HoloLens.

-   Make sure that the work or school account you’re using has a valid [Office
    365 Business](https://products.office.com/en-us/business/office) Premium or
    Essentials subscription with [Microsoft
    Teams](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software)
    enabled.

-   Make sure your HoloLens is connected to the Internet.

-   Check with your administrator to make sure your device and network are set
    up to work with Remote Assist.

**What languages is Remote Assist available in?**

Remote Assist is available in English only.

**Is group calling available in Remote Assist?**

Group calling isn’t available at this time, but we’re working on it. This
feature will be available sometime in 2019.

**What file formats does the Insert file feature support?**

The Insert file feature supports most image formats (JPG, GIF, PNG) and PDF
files.

**Can I share files from SharePoint on Remote Assist?**

No, you can only share local files and files from OneDrive.
