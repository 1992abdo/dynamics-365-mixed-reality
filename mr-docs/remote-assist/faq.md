# Dynamics 365 Remote Assist FAQ

Here are answers to common questions about using Microsoft [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)].

For additional information, see [Get help with
HoloLens](https://support.microsoft.com/products/hololens).

If you’re an IT admin and you want to deploy [!include[pn-remote-assist](../includes/pn-remote-assist.md)] to devices running
the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] Commercial Suite, see [Try or buy, and deploy Remote Assist](../licensing/buy-and-deploy.md). 

**Can I still use the preview app?**

The preview period has ended. Existing preview app customers have until December
31, 2018, to upgrade to a paid subscription. 

**Can I try the app before buying it?**

Yes, [!include[pn-remote-assist](../includes/pn-remote-assist.md)] is available as a free 30-day trial. For more information,

**What are the technical requirements for installing [!include[pn-remote-assist](../includes/pn-remote-assist.md)]?**

To use [!include[pn-remote-assist](../includes/pn-remote-assist.md)], you’ll need:

-   [A subscription to Dynamics 365 Remote Assist.](../licensing/buy-and-deploy.md)

-   A [HoloLens running the Windows 10 April 2018
    Update](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12643). 

-   A work or school account with an [Office 365
    Business](https://products.office.com/business/office) Premium or Essentials
    subscription.

-   A contact using the latest version of [Microsoft
    Teams](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) on a
    PC running Windows 10 to make a video call. Microsoft [!include[pn-teams](../includes/pn-teams.md)] is [available as
    a free download](https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads).


**How often is [!include[pn-remote-assist](../includes/pn-remote-assist.md)] updated?**

[!include[pn-remote-assist](../includes/pn-remote-assist.md)] will follow the Modern Lifecyle Policy with continuous service updates and major updates every 6 months (October/April). 

**How can I tell what version I'm using?**

Go to **Settings**, and then find the version number in the **About** section.

**Why am I not getting incoming call notifications?**

This can happen if you’re signed in to [!include[pn-remote-assist](../includes/pn-remote-assist.md)] with a different account
than the one you used to sign in to your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)]. Make sure you’re signed in to
both the app and the device with the same account. 

**I see a message saying I have no internet connection.**

To use [!include[pn-remote-assist](../includes/pn-remote-assist.md)], you need a Wi-Fi connection. Make sure your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] is
[connected to Wi-Fi](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12629).

**[!include[pn-remote-assist](../includes/pn-remote-assist.md)] is frozen or unresponsive.**

Try closing and reopening [!include[pn-remote-assist](../includes/pn-remote-assist.md)]. If you’re still having problems,
[restart your HoloLens](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12642).

**[!include[pn-remote-assist](../includes/pn-remote-assist.md)] isn't showing my contacts.**

If you don’t see the contacts you expect, try the following:

-   Make sure you’ve signed in to Microsoft [!include[pn-teams](../includes/pn-teams.md)] at least once with the account
    you’re using on your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)].

-   Close and reopen [!include[pn-remote-assist](../includes/pn-remote-assist.md)].

-   [Restart your HoloLens](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12642).

**The Mixed Reality toolbar doesn’t appear on the PC [!include[pn-teams](../includes/pn-teams.md)] client during a
[!include[pn-remote-assist](../includes/pn-remote-assist.md)] call.**

This might happen if [!include[pn-teams](../includes/pn-teams.md)] has downloaded a new version of the client in the
background but is still running the older version of the app. Restarting your PC
will usually fix this issue.

**Why does audio sometimes cut out even in quiet environments?**

If [!include[pn-remote-assist](../includes/pn-remote-assist.md)] is used in a loud environment, use headphones on both ends for
better communication. Using headphones for both users prevents any echo
filtering from proactively turning on noise cancellation, which turns off audio.

**Can I use [!include[pn-remote-assist](../includes/pn-remote-assist.md)] to place a call between two separate tenants?**

Yes, but only if the expert is calling as a guest on the other user’s tenant.
Currently, [!include[pn-remote-assist](../includes/pn-remote-assist.md)] doesn’t support two users calling each other even if
two tenants are joined by federation.

**Does Microsoft [!include[pn-teams](../includes/pn-teams.md)] include the same [!include[pn-remote-assist](../includes/pn-remote-assist.md)] features on all platforms and devices?**

No. Ink, arrows, and adding files are only available on [!include[pn-teams](../includes/pn-teams.md)] for PC.

**I signed in to my [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], but I still can't sign in to [!include[pn-remote-assist](../includes/pn-remote-assist.md)].**

If you’re having trouble signing in to [!include[pn-remote-assist](../includes/pn-remote-assist.md)]t, try the following:

-   Make sure you’re using a work or school account, not a Microsoft account, to
    sign in to [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)].

-   Make sure that the work or school account you’re using has a valid [Office
    365 Business](https://products.office.com/en-us/business/office) Premium or
    Essentials subscription with [Microsoft
    Teams](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software)
    enabled.

-   Make sure your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] is connected to the internet.

-   Check with your administrator to make sure your device and network are set
    up to work with [!include[pn-remote-assist](../includes/pn-remote-assist.md)].

**How do I set up Dynamics 365 for Field Service to work with [!include[pn-remote-assist](../includes/pn-remote-assist.md)]?**
