## Why am I not getting incoming call notifications?

This can happen if you’re signed in to [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)] with a different account
than the one you used to sign in to your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)]. Make sure you’re signed in to
both the app and the device with the same account. 

## I see a message saying I have no internet connection.

To use [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)], you need a Wi-Fi connection. Make sure your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] is
[connected to Wi-Fi](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12629).

## Dynamics 365 Remote Assist is frozen or unresponsive.

Try closing and reopening [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)]. If you’re still having problems,
[restart your HoloLens](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12642).

## Dynamics 365 Remote Assist isn't showing my contacts.

If you don’t see the contacts you expect, try the following:

-   Make sure you’ve signed in to [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-teams](../includes/pn-teams.md)] at least once with the account
    you’re using on your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)].

## The Mixed Reality toolbar doesn’t appear on the PC Teams client during a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call.

## Why does audio sometimes cut out even in quiet environments?

If [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)] is used in a loud environment, use headphones on both ends for
better communication. Using headphones for both users prevents any echo
filtering from proactively turning on noise cancellation, which turns off audio.

    sign in to [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)].

-   Make sure that the work or school account you’re using has a valid [Office
    365 Business](https://products.office.com/business/office) Premium or
    Essentials subscription with [Microsoft
    Teams](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software)
    enabled.

    up to work with [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)].

## Is group calling available in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens?

Yes, group calling is available starting in the April release of [!include[pn-dyn-365-remote-assist](../includes/pn-dyn-365-remote-assist.md)]. Up to 50 people can be on the same video call.

## What file formats does the Insert file feature support?

The Insert file feature supports most image formats (JPG, GIF, PNG) and PDF
files.

## Can I share files from SharePoint on Dynamics 365 Remote Assist?

No, you can only share local files and files from [!include[pn-onedrive](../includes/pn-onedrive.md)].

## When a Remote Assist call ends, how can I access the messages, snapshots, and files during the call?

Messages sent in text chat: Any messages, links, or images sent in the text chat will be available for all participants via Teams Chat but not via Remote Assist.

Snapshots from Remote Assist HoloLens user: snapshots are saved differently depending on whether the Remote Assist call is associated with a Dynamics 365 Field Service booking.
* If a Remote Assist call is associated with a booking, the Remote Assist user will take a snapshot and decide whether it to save it to OneDrive or to the booking.
* If a Remote Asist call is not associated with a booking, the Remote Assist user’s snapshot will automatically be saved in OneDrive.  
However, regardless of how snapshots are saved, a link to the snapshot is sent via the text chat, and the Teams user can view the snapshot and also view the link to the snapshot. 

Files: A link to the files sent by the Teams user is sent in the chat. During the call, the Remote Assist user can use the controls in the top right corner of a file to save it to their OneDrive.


# Using Remote Assist on mobile  

## What are the yellow tracking dots?

Yellow tracking dots are feature points that detects visually distinct features in your video calls. These helps with your tracking experience and placing of annotations. In the April 2020 release and beyond, Remote Assist will continue to track your space but you will remove the yellow tracking dots visualization

## How can I improve the tracking experience?

* Map your environment area at the beginning of a video call 
* Avoid rapid camera movements 
* Avoid frequently minimizing the app and re-opening it while there are annotations present 

Limitations that may hinder accurate understanding of surfaces or faciliate in losing tracking include:
* Flat surfaces without texture, such as a white desk 
* Environments with dim lighting or extremely bright lighting 
* Transparent or reflective surfaces like glass 
* Dynamic or moving surfaces

## As a Remote Assist mobile user, what kinds of calls can I be in?

* **Can I make calls to a Teams mobile user?** No. However, Remote Assist mobile to Remote Assist mobile calling is on our backlog.
* **Can I make or be in a group call?** No.
