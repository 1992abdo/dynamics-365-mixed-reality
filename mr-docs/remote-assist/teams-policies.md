# Microsoft Teams policies supported by Dynamics 365 Remote Assist

Dynamics 365 Remote Assist supports the following Microsoft Teams policies: 

- Video
- Call recording
- Chat messaging
 
Users in your organization will automatically get the global policy unless you create and assign a custom policy. You can edit the settings in the global policy or 
create and assign one or more custom policies to turn the features that you want on or off.  

> [!NOTE]
> You can't set policies for specific applications (for example, Dynamics 365 Remote Assist vs. Teams).  

## Video  

Video policies are used to control video stream capabilities. This does not include disabling the camera because the user can use MRC (Mixed Reality Capture).  Video policies also does not include disabling low bandwidth and Asset Capture.  

 

Note: If video is disabled users will not be able to leverage Mixed Reality annotations from remote participants.

## Call recording  

 

Call recording policies are used to control call recording capabilities. This allows admin to disable call recording for privacy purposes. If Call Recording is disabled through a policy, the Remote Assist user will not be able to start a recording.  

 

Note: This policy does not affect other participants in call, whom still may be able to start/stop recordings.

## Chat messaging  

Chat Messaging policies are used to control which chat and channel messaging features are available to users (owners and members) in Microsoft Teams.  

 

Chat Messaging policies in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist allow users to read chat but not send messages. Voice recording and photo capture will also be disabled since these features require chat. If Chat Messaging is disabled through a policy, the Remote Assist user will not receive incoming chat messages from Teams.
