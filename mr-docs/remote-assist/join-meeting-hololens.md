# Join a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist meeting on HoloLens


A Teams meeting is a meeting scheduled using Teams involving any number of participants. Meetings are useful for maintenance and repairs that are scheduled in advance. It's also useful for inspections and other recurring scenarios.

> ![Note]
> If a remote collaborator joins a meeting, you will not receive a call or notification, regardless whether you are in the app. You must select “Join Meeting” (or say “Join Meeting”) to join the meeting. In addition, calling the participants involved in a scheduled meeting will not enable you to join the meeting, you must actually join the meeting. 

If, for some reason, you are unable to join the meeting, you may also ask the Teams user to join the meeting and use the **Open Participants** feature to call you. You will receive an incoming call notification. Accept the call using audio or video, and you will join the meeting.

To join a meeting, select **Join Meeting** (or say “Remote Assist, Join Meeting”) below the **Recent Contacts** screen. The **Join Meeting** button appears if the meeting is happening now or within the next 15 minutes.

After you join a meeting, you or the Teams user can add more people to the meeting. Select **Open Participants** ![OpenParticipants](media/RAHL_Participants.png "OpenParticipants"). You will see the first person you called on the left side of the video card, and a list of participants on the right side of the video card. On the bottom of the video card is a text field. Click it, and a holographic keyboard will pop out. A list of your recent contacts will appear. If the person you'd like to call isn't on the list, enter a name or email address using the holographic keyboard, and then select a name in the search results to start the call.
