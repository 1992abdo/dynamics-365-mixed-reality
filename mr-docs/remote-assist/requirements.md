# Technical requirements for deploying and using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist

The following tables list technical requirements for deploying and using Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist.

## Device requirements

A Remote Assist call is between a Remote Assist user and a Microsoft Teams user.

Remote Assist is available on HoloLens, HoloLens 2, and qualifying AndroidÂ or iOS mobile devices.

To collaborate with a Remote Assist user, a Microsoft Teams user may only use the Teams application on Windows 10 PC or mobile devices.

### Device options and requirements for a Remote Assist user

| Remote collaborator (Uses Microsoft Teams) | - [Azure Active Directory (AAD)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) account  </br> - Teams license\*\*\* </br> - OneDrive for business\*\*\* </br> - Teams application on Windows 10 PC or mobile devices </br></br> Note: It is possible to use Teams to communicate with a Remote Assist user without acquiring a Teams license. Teams supports [guest access](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/guest-access), which lets an organization add individual users from outside their organization into their teams and channels. Anyone with a business or consumer email account, such as Outlook, Gmail, or others, can use Teams as a guest in another organization's tenant. </br></br> Note: The remote collaborator can use Teams for free, which offers [limited functionality](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/upgrade-freemium#how-does-teams-free-compare-to-the-full-version-of-teams).

\*\*The Teams license that is included with a Remote Assist license enables Remote Assist users to join a Remote Assist call, use mixed reality annotations, and use most Remote Assist features. However, some features, such as sharing files from OneDrive and saving snapshots to OneDrive, require the Remote Assist user to have a [OneDrive for Business](https://products.office.com/onedrive/onedrive-for-business) license. To use all Remote Assist features, a Remote Assist user may, for example, use the Teams license, [Microsoft Stream license](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/cloud-recording#prerequisites-for-teams-cloud-meeting-recording), and OneDrive for Business license that are included with [Office 365 Business Premium or Office 365 Business Essentials](https://products.office.com/en-us/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?&activetab=tab:primaryr2).

\*\*\*\*To use Remote Assist to view Dynamics 365 Field Service bookings, users will also need a Field Service license (version 8.2 or later). [Learn more about Dynamics 365 Field Service](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/field-service/overview/).

\*\*\*\*\*To use Remote Assist to open Power BI dashboards linked to Dynamics 365 Field Service bookings, users will also need a Power BI license. [Learn more about Power BI.](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/)

## Network requirements

A variety of network conditions, including bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet loss, can impact your video calling experience. Although audio and video calls might be possible in environments with reduced bandwidth, you might experience feature degradation.

In most circumstances:

-   [1.5Mbps up/down is required](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/prepare-network#bandwidth-requirements).
-   When more bandwidth is available, quality and usage will increase to deliver the best experience.
-   4-5Mbps up/down is required for peer-to-peer HD quality video calling with resolution of HD 1080p.

However, in some circumstances, even 4-5Mbps up/down does not guarantee 1080p video calling at full quality. Circumstances include using HoloLens (1st gen).

You can use Remote Assist on mobile devices inÂ low-bandwidth environmentsÂ between 150 kbps and 1.5 Mbps. For more information, see theÂ [low bandwidth documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/remote-assist/mobile-app/poor-network-connectivity).

### Network optimization recommendations

The following tasks serve as a checklist for other potential optimizations for Remote Assist:

- [Monitor your network using CQD and call analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/prepare-network#best-practice-monitor-your-network-using-cqd-and-call-analytics).
- Review Teams' recommendations [for optimizing your network](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/prepare-network#network-optimization).
- Be on a dedicated SSID. The dedicated SSID should be on the 5-Ghz band only; disable 2.4 Ghz.
- Use a router with MU-MIMO capabilities.

### Additional resources

- Learn how to troubleshoot and address internal infrastructure issues usingÂ [Teams Call Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/use-call-analytics-to-troubleshoot-poor-call-quality#troubleshoot-call-quality-problems-using-call-analytics) orÂ [Teams Call Quality Dashboard (CQD)](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/quality-of-experience-review-guide).
