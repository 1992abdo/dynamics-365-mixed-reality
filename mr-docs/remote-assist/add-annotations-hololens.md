# Add annotations in HoloLens

Once a video call has connected, the Microsoft Teams user will see everything the HoloLens user sees in their space – including holograms. Everyone on the call can draw and place arrows in your space. Annotations are particularly useful for pointing out parts of your space that may be difficult or dangerous for you to reach. Remote collaborators will see your additions, and will be able to make annotations of their own. Once an annotation is placed, all call participants can refer to it at any time until it is deleted. 

> ![Note]
> Multiple Teams desktop users can join and add annotations in a Remote Assist call. The Teams desktop user will see annotations others add even when the Teams desktop user is in edit mode. 
A Teams mobile user can only annotate in a one-to-one call with a Remote Assist user (either HoloLens or mobile). 
In other words, the following calls are supported:
* One-to-one call between 1 Remote Assist HoloLens user and 1 Teams desktop user
* One-to-one call between 1 Remote Assist HoloLens user and 1 Teams mobile user
* Group or meeting among 1 Remote Assist HoloLens user and 2+ Teams desktop user

## Add an arrow 

Select Arrow ![Arrow](media/RAHL_Arrow.png "Arrow"). As you position your hand to place the arrow, you should see a ghost arrow at the end of your hand ray. 
To control the direction of the arrow, airtap, hold, and move your hand in a circle until the ghost arrow appears at the desired direction. Release the airtap to place the arrow.
To use voice commands, select the arrow tool by saying “Remote Assist, Arrow.” Then use “Remote Assist, place arrow” to use head gaze to place the arrow. You will not be able to use voice commands to rotate the arrow before placing it.
Once you place the arrow, you cannot adjust its location or direction. To redo, select Undo (or say “Remote Assist, Undo”) and place the arrow again.

## Draw in your space

## Change arrow or ink color

Select Colors ![Color](media/RAHL_Color.png "Color") (or say “Remote Assist, colors”), and then select the color you want (or say “Remote Assist, Red”).

## Edit annotations

To erase all the arrows and ink you’ve added during a video call, select Erase all ![Trash](media/RAHL_Trash.png "Trash") at the top of the call window (or say “Erase all”).

To undo your most recent action, including Erase all, select Undo ![Undo](media/RAHL_Undo.png "Undo") at the top of the call window (or say “Undo”).
