# Add annotations in HoloLens

Once a video call has connected, the Microsoft Teams user will see everything the HoloLens user sees in their space – including holograms. 
Annotations are particularly useful for pointing out parts of your space that may be difficult or dangerous to reach. All call participants can see each others’ additions, and can make annotations of their own. Once an annotation is placed, it will remain anchored in your space until the person who placed the annotation deletes it.  Adding annotations to files works the same way.

The gestures for adding arrows or drawing ae the same for HoloLens 1 and HoloLens 2.

> ![Note]
> Multiple Teams desktop users can join and add annotations in a Remote Assist call when the Remote Assist user is using HoloLens. 
Only one Teams mobile user can join and add annotations in a Remote Assist call, regardless of whether the Remote Assist user is using HoloLens or mobile.
In other words, the following calls are supported:
* One-to-one call between 1 Remote Assist HoloLens user and 1 Teams desktop user
* One-to-one call between 1 Remote Assist HoloLens user and 1 Teams mobile user
* Group or meeting among 1 Remote Assist HoloLens user and 2+ Teams desktop user

## Add an arrow 

Select Arrow ![Arrow](media/RAHL_Arrow.png "Arrow"). As you position your hand to place the arrow, you should see a ghost arrow at the end of your hand ray. 

To position the arrow in space:
*	If you are using HoloLens 1, use your gaze cursor to position the arrow. You will see a ghost arrow on your gaze cursor.  
*	If you are using HoloLens 2, use your hand ray to position the arrow. You will see a ghost arrow at the end of your hand ray.


To control the direction of the arrow, airtap, hold, and move your hand in a circle until the ghost arrow appears at the desired direction. Release the airtap to place the arrow.


To use voice commands, select the arrow tool by saying “Remote Assist, Arrow.” Then use “Remote Assist, place arrow” to use head gaze to place the arrow. You will not be able to use voice commands to rotate the arrow before placing it.
Once you place the arrow, you cannot adjust its location or direction. To redo, select Undo (or say “Remote Assist, Undo”) and place the arrow again.

This video shows how to place an arrow using HoloLens 1 gestures. If you’re using HoloLens 2, remember that you can select the Arrow tool by touching it directly, and you position your arrow in space using your hand ray. 

## Draw in your space


Select the ink tool ![Ink](media/RAHL_Ink.png "Ink").


To determine where you start drawing,
* If you are using HoloLens 1, use your gaze cursor to determine where to start drawing.
* If you are using HoloLens 2, use your hand ray to determine where to start drawing.  

Then, airtap, keep your index finger and thumb together, and start drawing in space. Release the airtap to stop drawing. 

To use voice commands, select the ink tool by saying “Remote Asist, Ink.” Then use “Remote Assist, start inking” and “Remote Assist, stop inking” to start and stop inking with head gaze.

This video shows how to draw using HoloLens 1 gestures. If you’re using HoloLens 2, remember that you can select the Ink tool by touching it directly, and you determine where you start your drawing using your hand ray. 

## Change arrow or ink color

Select Colors ![Color](media/RAHL_Color.png "Color") (or say “Remote Assist, colors”), and then select the color you want (or say “Remote Assist, Red”).

## Edit annotations

To erase all the arrows and ink you’ve added during a video call, select Erase all ![Trash](media/RAHL_Trash.png "Trash") at the top of the call window (or say “Erase all”).

To undo your most recent action, including Erase all, select Undo ![Undo](media/RAHL_Undo.png "Undo") at the top of the call window (or say “Undo”).
