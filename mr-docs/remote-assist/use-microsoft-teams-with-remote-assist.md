# Overview

Dynamics 365 Remote Assist for HoloLens 1, HoloLens 2, mobile, and tablets enables technicians to connect and collaborate with a remote collaborators who use  Microsoft Teams on PC and mobile. Using live video calling and mixed reality annotations, they can troubleshoot problems together, faster.

Remote collaborators who use Teams on mobile or tablet can collaborate with Remote Assist users on-the-go. When you use Teams on mobile (Android or iOS), you can collaborate in one-to-one calls and Teams meetings with one collaborator who is using Remote Assist on HoloLens 1 or 2 (a “Remote Assist HoloLens user”). You can also collaborate with one collaborator who is using Remote Assist on mobile user (a “Remote Assist mobile user”). Learn the network requirements for a call here.
However, the features you can use to collaborate differ depending on whether you are collaborating with a Remote Assist HoloLens user or Remote Assist mobile user, and whether you’re using an ad hoc one-to-one call or a Teams meeting.
