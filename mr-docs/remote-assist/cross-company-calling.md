# Set up cross-company calling (for admins)

You can make or receive a 1:1 call with any Teams user outside of your domain through Teams external access. Group calls and 
file sharing with external users are not currently supported.

1.	Enable external access in your Microsoft Teams admin center. This allows you to make calls and chat with users outside your domain.

 
2.	By default, you’ll be able to communicate with any other domain that has external access on and has allowed external access with 
your domain. If you want to restrict this behavior, you can add allowed or blocked domains. For more detailed information about this, 
please visit Teams documentation on managing external access.

3.	Ensure the person you are trying to call also has external access enabled in their company’s Microsoft Teams admin center. 
If you aren’t sure if external access is configured between the two domains, try typing in the full email address of the person you are 
trying to call in Teams Desktop. When external access is allowed between both of your domains, Teams shows the following message and 
enables you to chat or call the external contact.
 
4.	Once you have confirmed or configured external access, simply oOpen the app and select Search  , and then use the holographic 
keyboard to enter the full email address of the external user.
Note: Searching for an external user from another company requires the full email address to be entered. Names or partial emails 
won’t generate search results for external users.
