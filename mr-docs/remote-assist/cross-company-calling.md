# Set up cross-company calling for Dynamics 365 Remote Assist (for admins)

Users in your organization can make or receive a one-on-one call with a Microsoft Teams user from another company (domain) if external access is enabled in Microsoft Teams for each domain. 

> [!NOTE]
> At this time, group calling and file sharing is not available for cross-company calling.

1.	[Enable external access](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/manage-external-access) in your Microsoft Teams Admin Center. This allows users in your organization to make calls and chat with users outside your domain.

   SCREEN SHOT GOES HERE
 
   By default, users will be able to communicate with users in any other domain that has external access on and has allowed external access with 
your domain. If you want to restrict this behavior, you can add allowed or blocked domains. For more information, 
see [Manage external access (federation) in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/manage-external-access).

3.	Ensure the person you are trying to call also has external access enabled in their company’s Microsoft Teams admin center. 
If you aren’t sure if external access is configured between the two domains, try typing in the full email address of the person you are 
trying to call in Teams Desktop. When external access is allowed between both of your domains, Teams shows the following message and 
enables you to chat or call the external contact.
 
4.	Once you have confirmed or configured external access, simply oOpen the app and select Search  , and then use the holographic 
keyboard to enter the full email address of the external user.
Note: Searching for an external user from another company requires the full email address to be entered. Names or partial emails 
won’t generate search results for external users.
