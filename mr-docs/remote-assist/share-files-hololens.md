# Share files

## Display your OneDrive file in your space

You can share a OneDrive file with remote collaborators. For example, you may want to show them a PDF of the instructions you tried using to resolve the issue. 

To display a OneDrive file during a video call, select OneDrive ![OneDrive](media/RAHL_OneDrive.png "OneDrive") (or say “Remote Assist, OneDrive”) and select the file you want to add. The file will then pop up as a new slate in your space, but a link to the OneDrive file will not be sent in the chat. Your remote collaborators will be able to see the image or PDF file as long as you’re looking at it. Supported files include .jpg, bmp, png, tif, pdf, and still gif.  

## Save a file sent by the Teams user

When a Teams user shares a file from OneDrive or from their device, it will pop up as a new slate in your space and a link to the file will be shared in the chat. Even after the call ends, you can find the link in your Teams chat. 

You may also want to save the file to your OneDrive for future reference. For example, the Teams user may send a PDF of a schematic you can use in future repairs, so you want to save it to your OneDrive and share the OneDrive file with others.

To save the file to OneDrive, tap OneDrive ![OneDrive](media/RAHL_OneDrive "OneDrive") icon in the top right of the slate. The OneDrive file is then automatically saved to a folder called “HoloLens Received Files.”
