# Review tutorial of Remote Assist on HoloLens

The first time you use Remote Assist on HoloLens, you will see a brief tutorial explaining core features of the app. To view this tutorial at any time, launch Remote Assist and select **Settings** in the top right corner. Select the **Links** tab, and in the **Account** section, you will see a question mark icon next to a link called â€œRun Tutorial."
