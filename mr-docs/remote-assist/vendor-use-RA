# Vendors and contractors use Remote Assist

## Introduction
A Remote Assist call involves one party (technician) using Remote Assist and the other using Teams (expert or remote collaborator).  In most cases, technician and remote collaborators all belong to the same tenant, and thus a [standard deployment of Remote Assist](deploy-remote-assist.md) and [standard deployment of Teams](set-up-teams.md) is all you need. 

However, there are certain scenarios where this may not be the case: 

1. **Scenario 1: Multi-tenant company deployments,** i.e., a company has a multi-tenant configuration across different organizations or business units. [Learn more about this scenario.](----) 

1. **Scenario 2: Vendors and contractors use Remote Assist,** i.e., a company wants vendors and contractors that arenâ€™t part of the company tenant to use Remote Assist. This document focuses on scenario 2.

>[!NOTE]
> This article is intended for administrators, and assumes that you have Microsoft Teams **AND** Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) admin privileges. You should also be familiar with the [Teams admin portal](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/).

## Account types

Throughout this article, we'll be referring to a few account types: 

1. **Internal account**: An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account that is created inside your tenant for internal users.
2. **Service account**: An Azure AD account that is created inside your tenant for users who are not currently part of your tenant.\

## Scenario overview

> [!Note] To appropriately license this scenario, please contact your Microsoft sales representative to license.

Companies frequently want to leverage non-company employees such as vendors or contractors to perform specific service tasks. In this case, companies still handle all license configuration, but want to enable their vendors or contractors to seamlessly use Remote Assist to collaborate with them. 

### Example

Company ABC uses Tenant ABC. Tenant ABC has users who want to use Teams to remotely collaborate with company vendors and contractors. Some of these vendors and contractors are in an existing tenant and others are not. Company ABC wants to give vendors and contractors Remote Assist licenses so they can use it for their daily service tasks. This scenario is depicted in Figure 2.1 

In Figure 2.1, Company ABC used Azure AD to create **service accounts** (SAs) inside Tenant ABC. Tenant ABC administrator assigned a Remote Assist license (Jason - anything else?) to each service account. Service account credentials were then distributed to company vendors and contractors.
* Bob@Contoso1.com is still a member of Contoso1, and now uses SA1@ABC.com to log in to Remote Assist to collaborate with Teams users in Tenant ABC.
* Toni@Contoso1.com is still a member of ContosoN, and now uses SA2@ABC.com to log in to Remote Assist to collaborate with Teams users in Tenant ABC.
* User@Outlook.com was not a member of any other tenant - that contractor uses a regular personal email (e.g. @outlook.com) for work. Now, user@outlook.com users SA3@ABC.com to log in to Remote Assist to collaborate with Teams users in Tenant ABC.

**Figure 2.1**

[!Note] If Tenant ABC does not configure information barriers, any service account user can search for and communicate with any other service account user or internal account user in Tenant ABC. Learn more about information barriers and how to configure them [here](how-to-lease-ra.md).

[!Note] Because Teams users and Remote Assist users are all in Tenant ABC, they can each search for users they are allowed to search for by typing that user's name, rather than typing their entire email address.

### Implementation

If you are following the steps in the [Deploy HoloLens in a Commercial Environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens-requirements#apps) article, go back to that document before implementing this solution.

Otherwise, please learn how to [Provide Remote Assist licenses to users outside your tenant](how-to-lease-ra.md).
















# How to enable vendors and contractors to use Remote Assist 

This document assumes that you have read our [Remote Assist advanced deployment scenarios](out-of-tenant-overview.md) document. 

Information barriers are a great way to control who can search and collaborate with one another when using Microsoft Teams and Remote Assist. Specifically, information barrier policies determine and prevent the following kinds of unauthorized communications:

- Searching for a user
- Adding a member to a team
- Starting a chat session with someone
- Starting a group chat
- Inviting someone to join a meeting
- Sharing a screen
- Placing a call

Additional information about information barriers can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/information-barriers?view=o365-worldwide#what-happens-with-information-barriers).

In this article, we'll take a look at how to deploy Remote Assist licenses for users who are outside your tenant but still in your company. 

## Step 1. Determine if information barriers are necessary

### Overview of information barriers

Information barriers are a great way to control who can search and collaborate with one another when using Microsoft Teams and Remote Assist. Information barriers use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) attributes to segment Azure AD users. The segmentation of users determines which users can talk to one another. Information barrier policies determine and prevent the following kinds of unauthorized communications:

- Searching for a user
- Adding a member to a team
- Starting a chat session with someone
- Starting a group chat
- Inviting someone to join a meeting
- Sharing a screen
- Placing a call

Information barriers use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) attributes to segment Azure AD users. You can configure which segments can search and collaborate with other segments. 

It's important to plan how you segment users. You can segment users based on different attributes, such as what department they belong to, what Azure AD group they are a member of, or even by their usage location. A full list of attributes can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/information-barriers-attributes?view=o365-worldwide#reference). To see how an organization might approach defining segments and policies, consider the following [example](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/information-barriers-policies?view=o365-worldwide#example-contosos-departments-segments-and-policies). A downloadable Excel workbook is available to help you plan and define your segments and policies (and create your PowerShell cmdlets). [Get the workbook.](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/OfficeDocs-O365SecComp/raw/public/SecurityCompliance/media/InfoBarriers-PowerShellGenerator.xlsx). Additional information about information barriers can be found [here].


### Information barrier example

Company ABC wants Company ABC support engineers to use Teams and vendors at vendor companies V1, V2, and V3 to use Remote Assist. Company ABC must create a service account for each vendor in V1, V2, and V3 and assign a Remote Assist license to each service account. By default, Company ABC experts and all service account users in V1, V2, and V3 can search and call each other. Company ABC wants to use information barriers to limit V1 to only searching and collaborating with the Company ABC support engineers assigned to collaborate with V1, and same for V2 and V3.

Company ABC decides to segment users based on the "Group" attribute:
* Remote Assist users in V1 are in Group "V1_RemoteAssistUser"
* Teams users who collaborate with V1 are in Group "V1_SupportEngineer"
* Remote Assist users in V2 are in Group "V2_RemoteAssistUser"
* Teams users who collaborate with V2 are in Group "V2_SupportEngineer"
* Remote Assist users in V3 are in Group "V3_RemoteAssistUser"
* Teams users who collaborate with V3 are in Group "V3_SupportEngineer"
 
Then, Company ABC sets up bi-directional searching and collaborating between:
* "V1_RemoteAssistUser" and "V1_SupportEngineer"
* "V2_RemoteAssistUser" and "V2_SupportEngineer"
* "V3_RemoteAssistUser" and "V3_SupportEngineer"

>[!NOTE]
> Infomation barriers enable bidirectional searching and collaborating, not unidirectional searching and collaborating.

> - [Overview of segmentation and attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/information-barriers-attributes?view=o365-worldwide).


## Step 2. Buy the correct licenses

The following licenses are required to enable a service account user to use Remote Assist.

- [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis#who-uses-azure-ad)
- [Remote Assist](buy-remote-assist.md)
- Microsoft Teams

If you would like to control who the service account user can search and collaborate with, you will need to assign the service account a information barrier license. The following licensing suites include information barrier licenses:

- Microsoft 365 E5
- Office 365 E5
- Office 365 Advanced Compliance
- Microsoft 365 E5 Information Protection and Compliance

For more information, see [Updated list of Information Barrier licenses](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/information-barriers?view=o365-worldwide#required-licenses-and-permissions)
