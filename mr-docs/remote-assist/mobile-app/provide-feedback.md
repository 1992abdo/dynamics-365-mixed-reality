# Provide feedback in the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile app

Technicians can provide feedback or make requests directly in the Remote Assist mobile app. Providing in-app feedback is the best way for the Remote Assist mobile team to troubleshoot your issue because we can use your applications logs to see if there is an issue on our side. The Remote Assist mobile team values your feedback and strives to make significant improvements to the app. 

>[!Note]
> Remote Assist mobile users can also provide feedback to our team in the [Dynamics 365 Community Forum](https://community.dynamics.com/365/remoteassist) for Remote Assist or in the [Dynamics 365 Application Ideas](https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/categories/list/?category=81a97e52-9c54-e911-a963-000d3a4f33c1&forum=4323c621-52bc-e811-a975-000d3a1bec70) for Remote Assist mobile.
