# Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile overview

Dynamics 365 Remote Assist enables technicians with mobile devices to connect to a remote collaborator on Remote Assist mobile or Microsoft Teams (desktop and mobile). Using live video calling, mixed-reality annotations, and high-resolution snapshots, they can share what they see with the remote collaborator to troubleshoot problems together, faster. 

Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile has been beneficial in scenarios where technicians may need physical access to confined or hard-to-reach spaces and/or access to other mobile apps that are part of their organizations' workflows. With the availability and familiarity with mobile devices, technicians can use Remote Assist mobile during repairs and inspections with ease. Furthermore, Remote Assist mobile allows for easier broad scale deployment in organizations. 

Dynamics 365 Remote Assist is available on Android phones and tablets with ARCore support and iOS iPhones and iPads with ARKit support. Additionally, Remote Assist is available on mobile devices **without** ARCore or ARKit support, too! You can find the full list of augmented reality (AR) supported devices on [Android](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices) and [iOS](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices#ios).
