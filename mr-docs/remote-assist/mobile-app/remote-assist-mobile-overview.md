# Remote Assist mobile overview

Dynamics 365 Remote Assist enables technicians with mobile devices to connect to a remote collaborator on Remote Assist mobile or Microsoft Teams (desktop and mobile). Using live video calling, mixed-reality annotations, and high-resolution snapshots, they can share what they see with the remote collaborator to troubleshoot problems together, faster. 

When technicians use Remote Assist mobile, they may find they have easier physical access to confined or hard-to-reach spaces with their mobile devices. In addition, technicians' have easy access to other mobile apps that are part of their organizations' workflows. This familiarity with mobile devices allows an overall ease of use while conducting repairs and inspections.
