# Remote Assist Mobile Overview

###
Dynamics 365 Remote Assist for mobile phones or tablets enables technicians to connect and collaborate with a remote expert on Microsoft Teams (desktop and mobile). Using live video calling, annotations, and high-resolution snapshots, they can share what they see with the expert to troubleshoot problems together, faster.
