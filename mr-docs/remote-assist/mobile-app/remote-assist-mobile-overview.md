# Remote Assist mobile overview

Dynamics 365 Remote Assist enables technicians with mobile devices to connect to a remote collaborator on Microsoft Teams (desktop and mobile). Using live video calling, mixed-reality annotations, and high-resolution snapshots, they can share what they see with the remote collaborator to troubleshoot problems together, faster. When technicians use Remote Assist mobile, they may find they have easier physical access to confined or hard-to-reach spaces. Also, technicians' familiarity with their mobile device facilitates ease of use and easy access to other mobile apps that are part of your company workflows.
