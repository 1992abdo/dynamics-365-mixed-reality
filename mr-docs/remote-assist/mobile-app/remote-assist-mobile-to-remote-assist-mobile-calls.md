# Calls between Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile users

Technicians using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile can now call and collaborate with other Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile users! This opens up many new scenarios for technicians, including peer-to-peer collaboration with other technicians using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile rather than Microsoft Teams desktop or mobile.

A Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile user can join a one-to-one or group calls  with other Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile users. To answer this call on Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile, the technician receiving the invitation to join the call must **not** have Teams mobile installed on their mobile device.

> [!NOTE]
> This guide documents a call between two Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile users; learn about group calls with at least three Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile users [here](group-calling.md).

## Prerequisites

- Call receivers must **not** have the Microsoft Teams application on their mobile devices. 
- Technicians must have a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist [free trial](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/remote-assist/try-remote-assist) or [subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/remote-assist/buy-remote-assist).
- Remote collaborators must have a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist free trial or subscription and a Microsoft Teams [free trial or subscription](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software). Learn to set up Dynamics 365 Remote Assist with [Teams desktop](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/remote-assist/teams-pc-all) and [Teams mobile](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/remote-assist/teams-mobile-all).

## How it works

1. Launch and sign into Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on your iOS or Android phone or tablet.

2. Search for the remote collaborator's name.

3. Select the remote collaborator's name and launch a call.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the remote collaborator is receiving the call on a mobile device with both Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile and Teams mobile installed, the remote collaborator can only answer on Teams mobile.

4. If the remote collaborator answers the call on **Remote Assist mobile**, the technician's live video feed will be shared to the remote collaborator's device screen.

7. Both call participants can place annotations in the shared environment either in their own environment or by selecting **Start Annotating**. 

> [!NOTE] 
> After the remote collaborator selects **Start Annotating**, they can add mixed reality annotations on a frozen frame of the shared environment. Afterwards, they can select the **Check Mark** and then the annotation will appear in the technician's shared environment.

8. With the call controls toolbar, the technician can disable the video call (enter an audio-only call), mute themselves in call, turn on their speakers, record the call, share their environment, or end the call.
