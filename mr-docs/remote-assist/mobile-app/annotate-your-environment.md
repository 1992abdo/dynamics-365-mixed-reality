# Annotate your Environment 

Annotations enables technicians and remote experts to easily specify an area or particular asset to look at or manipulate rather than verbally trying to convey this. Both the technician and expert can place annotations to their device's screen to share with each other during a video call. 

## Annotating your environment customer scenario (for technicians only)
1. The annotation toolbar allows technicians to place **Arrows** and **Drawings** into their environment. The **Color picker** changes the color of your annotations. The **Undo** icon allows technicians to remove the last annotation that they placed in their environment. The **Delete All** icon allows technicians to remove all annotations that they placed in their environment (they cannot remove the expert's annotations).
