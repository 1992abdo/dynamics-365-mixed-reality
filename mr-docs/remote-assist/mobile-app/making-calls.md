# Make Remote Assist mobile calls with augmented reality supported devices

Remote Assist mobile makes receiving expert help easy by providing technicians with the ability to launch one-to-one video calls with remote collaborators inside or outside of their organization. Making calls with Remote Assist mobile is available in these three scenarios: 
1. A call between two Remote Assist mobile users
2. A call between a Remote Assist mobile user and a Teams desktop user
3. A call between a Remote Assist mobile user and a Teams mobile user

> [!NOTE] 
> The following scenarios are **not** supported on Remote Assist mobile at this time:
> - Joining Teams meetings.
> - Making calls to browser-based Teams.
> - Participating in calls with three or more participants.
> - Participating in Remote Assist mobile to Remote Assist on HoloLens calls.
