# Capture 2D Snapshot and Annotate 

###
Remote Assist Mobile provides technicians with the ability to take 2D snapshots and annotate it during a call. Technicians can take a photo of their environment or mixed reality annotations in their environment. These snapshots can be used for reference later or work validation. 

## Capture 2D snapshot and annotate scenario
1. During a Remote Assist Mobile call, tap the 2D Annotation icon. 
2. After you tap the icon, you have now snapped your photo. If the technician does not want to add annotations to the snapshot, you can skip to Step 6. 
3. This snapshot is shared to the expert's screen. 
4. Both the technician and expert can add annotations to the snapshot. 
5. After both the technician and expert are finished annotating on the snapshot, the technician selects the Check Mark to exit from the 2D Annotation mode. 
6. After the technician selects the Check Mark, the technician can Save the snapshot to the phone's Photo Gallery or discard the snapshot. 
7. If the technician selects Save, the technician is alerted that the snapshot is saved to the phone's Photo Gallery. 
8. The technician is taken directly back to the video call. 
9. If the technician selects Discard, the technician is taken directly back to the video call.

Snapshots can also be utilized in low bandwidth situations.
