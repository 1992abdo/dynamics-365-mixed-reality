# Capture and Annotate a 2D Snapshot 

###
Remote Assist Mobile provides technicians with the ability to capture 2D snapshots and annotate it during a call. Technicians can take a photo of their environment or mixed reality annotations in their environment. 2D snapshots are critical in situations where a still-image might be needed to carefully add annotations to it. These 2D snapshots can be used for reference later or work validation. These 2D snapshots can also be utilized in low bandwidth situations.

## Annotate a 2D snapshot customer scenario
1.	During a Remote Assist Mobile call, tap the 2D Annotation icon to snap your photo. 
2.	If the technician does not want to add annotations to the snapshot, you can skip to Step 6.
3.	This snapshot is shared to the expert's screen.
4.	Both the technician and expert can add annotations to the snapshot.
5.	After both the technician and expert are finished annotating on the snapshot, the technician selects the Check Mark to exit from the 2D Annotation mode.
6.	After the technician selects the Check Mark, the technician can Save the snapshot to the phone's Photo Gallery or discard the snapshot.
7.	If the technician selects Save, the technician is alerted that the snapshot is saved to the phone's Photo Gallery.
1.	The technician is taken directly back to the video call and can select the 2D snapshot icon to take more snapshots.
2.	If the technician selects Discard, the technician is taken directly back to the video call and can select the 2D snapshot icon to take more snapshots in the future.
3.	At the end of the call, the technicians can now go to their mobile deviceâ€™s Photo Gallery and view the 2D snapshot. They can share it with others.
