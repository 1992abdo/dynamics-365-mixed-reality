Dynamics 365 Remote Assist Mobile includes a tutorial for technicians to jumpstart their ability to use the app. This tutorial instructs technicians to effectively: 
- map their environment for better tracking of surfaces
- place and manipulate annotations, such as the arrow and the ink tool

## Tips

What are the yellow tracking dots?
