## Tips 
###
What are the yellow tracking dots?
- Yellow tracking dots are feature points that detects visually distinct features in your video calls. These helps with your tracking experience and placing of annotations. 

Techniques to improve the tracking experience include:
-	Map your environment area at the beginning of a video call
- Avoid rapid camera movements
- Avoid frequently minimizing the app and re-opening it while there are annotations present 

Limitations that may hinder accurate understanding of surfaces or faciliate in losing tracking include:
- Flat surfaces without texture, such as a white desk
- Environments with dim lighting or extremely bright lighting
- Transparent or reflective surfaces like glass
- Dynamic or moving surfaces
