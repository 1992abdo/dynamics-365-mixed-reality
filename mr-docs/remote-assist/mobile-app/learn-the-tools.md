## Prerequisites 
- Allow Remote Assist Mobile to access your device's camera.

## Additional notes 

### What are the yellow tracking dots?
- Yellow tracking dots are feature points that detect visually distinct features in your video calls. These dots help with your tracking experience and the placing of annotations. 

### Techniques to improve the tracking experience
- Map your environment area at the beginning of a video call.
- Avoid rapid camera movements.
- Avoid frequently minimizing the app and reopening it while there are annotations present.

### Tracking limitations

Limitations that may hinder accurate understanding of surfaces or facilitate in losing tracking include:
- Flat surfaces without texture, such as a white desk
- Environments with dim lighting or extremely bright lighting
- Transparent or reflective surfaces like glass
- Dynamic or moving surfaces
