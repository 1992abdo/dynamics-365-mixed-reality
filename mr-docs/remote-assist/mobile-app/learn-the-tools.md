-	Map your environment area at the beginning of a video call
- Avoid rapid camera movements
- Avoid frequently minimizing the app and re-opening it while there are annotations present 

Limitations that may hinder accurate understanding of surfaces or faciliate in losing tracking include:

- Environments with dim lighting or extremely bright lighting
- Transparent or reflective surfaces like glass
- Dynamic or moving surfaces
