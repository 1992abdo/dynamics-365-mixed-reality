# Low Bandwidth Mode

### 
Most of our technicians work on factory floors or remote locations without strong network connectivity. This inhibits our technicians from troubleshooting and resolving problems in real-time. Now, Remote Assist Mobile provides technician with the ability to discuss, diagnose, and resolve issues with remote experts even in low bandwidth scenarios. 
###
This feature auto-detects the technicianâ€™s bandwidth. If the bandwidth is between 500 kbps and 1.5 Mbps, it is considered low and the technician is prompted to share snapshots with the remote expert to collaborate on instead of transmitting a live video feed. This enables the expert to annotate a high-quality image instead of a low-resolution snapshot of the video. 

## Low bandwidth customer scenario: 
###
1. The technician launches a video call with a remote expert. 
2. In the call, Remote Assist Mobile detects that the technician's bandwidth is low. It prompts the technician to use the snapshot tool to share images to the expert. 
3. The technician is instructed to use the snapshot tool. 
4. The technician takes a snapshot and it is shared to the expert's screen. The expert now sees a high-quality snapshot! 
5. The technician and expert can annotate simultaneously on the snapshot. 
6. After sharing a snapshot, the technician can save it to the mobile phone's camera roll or discard it. 
7. The technician now returns to the video call and can continue to send snapshots to the expert.
