# Annotate the technician's shared environment

In Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile, mixed reality annotations give technicians and remote collaborators the power to visually specify an area or particular asset in their environment to look at or manipulate. During a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile video call, the technicians will share their environment with the remote collaborator through their rear-facing camera. The technician can instantly place mixed reality annotations on their shared environment. However, the remote collaborator must place mixed reality annotations on a snapshot of the technician's shared environment. After the remote collaborator adds mixed reality annotations to the technician's shared environment, the annotations will appear in the shared environment. 

## Annotation toolbar 

The annotation toolbar allows technicians to place **Arrows** and **Drawings** into their environment. The **Color picker** changes the color of your annotations. The **Undo** icon allows technicians to remove the last annotation that they placed in their environment. The **Delete All** icon allows technicians to remove all annotations that they placed in their environment (they cannot remove the expert's annotations).
