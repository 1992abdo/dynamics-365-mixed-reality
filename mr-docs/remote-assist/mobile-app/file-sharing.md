# Share files between technicians and experts to improve collaboration

Remote Assist for mobile provides technicians and remote collaborators with document sharing capabilities. Sharing documents promotes seamless collaboration during a call by adding more context and information, such as visual aids and schematics, to the techniciansâ€™ environment. This facilitates technicians having richer conversations with remote collaborators and, ultimately, solve their problems quickly and efficiently.  
 
Both the technician and remote collaborators can send any file type to each other. This includes pictures, videos, PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, machine logs, .txt files, .apk files, and more. They can upload files from their local device or OneDrive. 

If you're a Dynamics 365 Field Service customer, the files shared during your Remote Assist for mobile call can be linked to your work order, learn more here.

## How it works
1. The technician must select the text chat to start sharing files to the remote collaborator. 

2. In the text chat, the technician is presented with the Attachment and Image icons. Select the Image icon. 

3. If the technician selects the Image icon, the technician gets the option to choose to select images from the device's Photo Gallery or Files apps. 
![Note] For iOS, the technician is presented with the Photos app directly. On Android, it can either be a gallery or a menu to choose which app to use as a picture chooser.

4. Select the Attachment icon. 

5. If the technician selects the Attachment icon, an option of files from the technician's local device shows up. 
![Note] For iOS, the technician is presented with the Files app directly. On Android, it can either be a file chooser or a menu to choose which app to use as a file chooser.

6. The technician taps the file or image that he/she wants to send to the expert. The technician can see the uploading progress until it's ready to be sent.

7. The technician taps the send icon and the file link or image preview is sent to the expert through OneDrive, which sets the permission to send/share the file with the remote expert. Afterwards, the expert on Teams receives a link to the document in OneDrive in the Microsoft Teams text chat.

8. The expert has full access to the document
