# Capture session history through call recordings 

###
With call recording, technicians can capture a comprehensive documentation of their Remote Assist for mobile calls with remote collaborators. Call recordings can be used as reference for follow-up work, validation that the maintenance and repair process was completed correctly, and training material for your workers.

This feature is only available in calls between **two participants** with **Remote Assist for mobile and Microsoft Teams desktop**. Only, the Remote Assist for mobile user can start and stop a call recording. 

## How it works
1.	The technician selects the **record button** to start the recording. 

2.	The call recorder may be loading. 

3.	Once the recording has started, the recording button indicator will be started and technician will receive a dismissible privacy notification with Microsoftâ€™s privacy policy.  

4. During all parts of the call, the technician will be aware that they are still being recorded as seen in the recording indicator in the text chat. 

5.	The Remote Assist for mobile user can select the Record button to stop the call recording at any point in their call. After selecting the Record button to stop the call, both call participants will receive a dismissible notification that the call recording will be available in Microsoft Stream. Once it is uploaded, both participants can access it through the Remote Assist for mobile call text chat, Microsoft Teams text chat, or on the Microsoft Stream website.
