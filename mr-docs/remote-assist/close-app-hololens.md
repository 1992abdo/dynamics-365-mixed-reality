# Close Remote Assist on HoloLens

To fully close the app, go to the **Start menu**, select **home** at the bottom, look around your space for the 3D app viewer, and press the **x** under the 3D app viewer.

If you want to close the app in order to use Remote Assist to show a remote collaborator what you are seeing in another app, see [NeedLink: add link to Use Dynamics 365 Remote Assist to get help in another HoloLens app.]
