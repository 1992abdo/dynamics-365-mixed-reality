# Take a snapshot (and save it to a Dynamics 365 Field Service booking)

## Take a snapshot

During a call, you can take a snapshot of your mixed reality annotations if your admin has turned on Office 365 and enabled OneDrive. For example, you can use a snapshot to document the quality of the assets you’re inspecting. If your network connectivity is poor, you can send a snapshot to your remote collaborators can clearly see an intricate part of the machine or a machine tag with small characters. 

To take a snapshot, select **Camera** ![Camera](media/RAHL_Camera.png "Camera) (or say “Remote Assist, Camera”), and then air tap (or say “Snap”) to take the photo.

## Save a snapshot to OneDrive or an open Dynamics 365 Field Service booking

Snapshots are saved differently depending on whether the Remote Assist call is associated with a Dynamics 365 Field Service booking. 
* If the call is associated with a booking, after you take the snapshot, you will see an option to save it to OneDrive or to the booking. (A call is associated with a booking if, from the Recent Contacts page, you select Dynamics and a select booking.) (A call is associated with a booking if, from the Recent Contacts page, you selected a booking.)
* If a Remote Asist call is not associated with a booking, your snapshot will automatically be saved in OneDrive.  

Regardless of how snapshots are saved, they are sent via the text chat, and the Teams user can view the snapshot and also view the link to the snapshot. Any call participant can view this link after the call ends by opening the chat log in Teams.
