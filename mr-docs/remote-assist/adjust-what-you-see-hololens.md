# Adjust what you see

## Position the call window 

You can pin the call window in your space, or you can have it follow you around. After you join the call, you may want to pin the call window to your left or right so you can look at the task in front of you. 

Pin ![Pin](media/RAHL_Pin.png "Pin") fixes the call window in a specific location in your space, not at a fixed distance from you. Unpin will enable the call window to follow you at a fixed distance. No matter where you are and whether the video card is pinned or unpinned, it will face you.

To pin and unpin the call window: 
* Select Pin ![Pin](media/RAHL_Pin.png "Pin")(or say “Remote Assist, Pin”). To have the call window follow you again, say select the Unpin button (or say “Remote Assist, Unpin.”)
*	If you walk away from a pinned call window and can’t see it, you can say “Remote Assist, Unpin” and it will fly to wherever you are. 


## Switch the displayed video feed   

As the HoloLens user, you can only see one remote collaborator’s video feed at a time. There are two ways to switch the displayed video feed in a group call or meeting.

1. You can switch video feeds from the **Participant Tray** located below the video feed. Select an avatar to switch to their outgoing video feed (or avatar, if their outgoing video is disabled). 
2. Another method is to select Open Participants ![OpenParticpants](media/RAHL_Participants.png "OpenParticpants") (or say, “Remote Assist, Open Participants”). Select the participant whose video feed you want to switch to. If that participant's video feed is enabled, the video will switch to their outgoing video feed (or avatar, if their outgoing video is disabled).


## See a Teams user’s desktop or mobile screen  

The remote collaborator can share their desktop or application window with you to assist with the call. When they share their desktop or running application this way, the feed of a collaborator, which is shown on the video card, will change to that collaborator’s avatar. Their screen will appear as a new slate. To move, size, or close the shared window, use the controls at the top right of the shared window.

You'll still be able to use all the tools on the video card even though you are no longer seeing your collaborator’s video feed. Your collaborators will still be able to see what you’re looking at unless you turn off outgoing video feed.
