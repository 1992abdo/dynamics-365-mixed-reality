# Adjust what you see

## Position the call window 

You can pin the call window in your space, or you can have it follow you around. After you join the call, you may want to pin the call window to your left or right so you can look at the task in front of you. 

Pin ![Pin](media/RAHL_Pin.png "Pin") fixes the call window in a specific location in your space, not at a fixed distance from you. Unpin will enable the call window to follow you at a fixed distance. No matter where you are and whether the video card is pinned or unpinned, it will face you.

To pin and unpin the call window: 
* Select Pin ![Pin](media/RAHL_Pin.png "Pin")(or say “Remote Assist, Pin”). To have the call window follow you again, say select the Unpin button (or say “Remote Assist, Unpin.”)
*	If you walk away from a pinned call window and can’t see it, you can say “Remote Assist, Unpin” and it will fly to wherever you are.
