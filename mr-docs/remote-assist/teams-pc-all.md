# Collaborate with a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist user via Microsoft Teams desktop application

When you use the Teams desktop application on a PC running Windows 10, you can collaborate with people using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens or HoloLens 2 (in this article, a "Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user") or Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on a mobile device (in this article, a "Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile user").  

However, the features you can use to collaborate differ depending on which platform the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist user is using.

### Call a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist user who is outside your tenant	

You can search, call, and receive a call from a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist user in another tenant if your tenant is federated with that tenant. When searching for this Dynamics 365 Remote Assist user, you must enter their full email address.

>[!Note]
> If you're not able to find the contact you're looking for, it might be because Teams federation ("[Teams external access](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/manage-external-access)") has not been enabled. Contact your administrator for help.  

### Make a group call 

Learn more about who can join a [group call](mobile-app/making-calls-on-remote-assist-mobile.md).

Start by calling one person, and then select **Open Participants** (represented by this icon: ![Graphic showing the participants icon.](media/Teams_Participants.png)). Then, search for the person you would like to call and call them.

## Schedule and join a meeting (with a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user only)

### Schedule a meeting ahead of the call (with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user only)

Read about how to [schedule a meeting here](https://support.office.com/article/Schedule-a-meeting-in-Teams-943507a9-8583-4c58-b5d2-8ec8265e04e5#ID0EAABAAA=Desktop), or [watch a tutorial video](https://support.office.com/article/Video-Manage-meetings-ba44d0fd-da3c-4541-a3eb-a868f5e2b137).

### Join a Teams meeting  (with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user only)

Read about how to [join a Teams meeting here](https://support.office.com/article/join-a-meeting-in-teams-1613bb53-f3fa-431e-85a9-d6a91e3468c9), or [watch a tutorial video](https://support.office.com/article/join-a-teams-meeting-078e9868-f1aa-4414-8bb9-ee88e9236ee4?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).

If the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user has been invited to the meeting, they can log into Dynamics 365 Remote Assist and select **Join Meeting** at the bottom of the **Recent Contacts** page.

If a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user was not invited to the meeting, but you would like them to join the meeting: join the meeting, then select **Participants** panel from call controls, start typing their name, and call them. 

## Adjust what you see

Teams tries to anticipate what youâ€™ll want to see in a meeting, and you can also manually [pin a video, reframe a video, and more]( https://support.office.com/article/adjust-your-view-in-a-teams-meeting-9825091c-0e7d-4c2b-95f5-eba644f19175).

>[!Note]
> At this time, when you use Teams to capture a cloud-based recording of the call, the layout you configure is not the layout captured in the call recording. The layout of the recording is determined by the number of call participants. See two examples below.

*Example of a Teams recording of call with two participants:*
![Screenshot showing two people in a Microsoft Teams call.](media/2call.png) 

*Example of a Teams recording of call with more than four participants:*
![Screenshot showing five people in a Microsoft Teams call.](media/5call.png)

If you want the recording to capture the exact layout of the call you configure, [use the Windows Game Bar](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/remote-assist/teams-pc-all#desktop-screen-recording-using-windows-game-bar) to capture a screen recording of your computer. 

## Use call controls

When you are in a call, call controls are found at the bottom of the screen. 
- ![The video icon](media/Teams_Video.png) Controls outgoing video.
- ![The microphone icon](media/Teams_Microphone.png) Controls outgoing audio. 
- ![The share icon](media/Teams_Share.png) Shares your desktop or a running application (with a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user only).
-	![The text chat icon](media/Teams_Text.png) Opens a chat window to send text messages 
-	![The participants icon](media/Teams_Participants.png ) See current participants, or add more.

To use additional features, select the ellipses icon [â€¦]. For example, select **Blur my background** if you have sensitive information behind you or want to protect the privacy of colleagues who are behind you. When you are in a group call or meeting with a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user, the More Options [â€¦] panel will also provide the option to record the call.  

## Add annotations in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist user's environment 

When in a call, you will see your collaboratorâ€™s spaceâ€”including the hologramsâ€”and can use the **Mixed Reality toolbar** to add annotations.

![Screenshot of the mixed reality toolbar.](media/071f358ab6bbf7c2072b15d9203a1593.png)

### Begin editing 

To start annotating, first do one of the following to pause the video stream and enter edit mode:

-   Select anywhere in the call window.

-   Select one of the items on the Mixed Reality toolbar.

-   Select **Start editing**.

>[!Note]
> By default, the **Mixed Reality toolbar** is on the top of your screen. If it is blocking your view and you'd like to move it somewhere else, select the drag icon (as seen here: ![Graphic showing the drag icon.](media/PC_Drag.png)) and drag the **Mixed Reality toolbar** where you would like it to be.
> The **Mixed Reality toolbar** is not currently draggable in Teams Multi-Window. 

In edit mode, the expert will still see a live stream of the call in the corner of the app window, including the annotations that other call participants add.

### Add arrows, ink, and files

Use the **Mixed Reality toolbar** to place arrows, draw, or add files in the HoloLens user's space:

- To add arrows, select **Place arrow** (as seen here: ![Graphic showing the place arrow icon.](media/6584f4b7932378aa23f6efbf460b304c.png)).

- To add ink, select **Ink** (as seen here: ![Graphic showing the ink icon, which looks like a pen.](media/187307e30fd713f5ae67aba854b78bc4.png)).

- To change the arrow or ink color, select **Pick a color** (as seen here: ![Graphic showing the pick a color icon.](media/5d9d3c70cf19ed175a8dc1ad71a60fc5.png)).

- To add a file in HoloLens user's space, select  **Insert files** (as seen here: ![Graphic showing the insert files icon.](media/41aa538d3be8e163215f7d9374abe90e.png)), and then add an image file or a PDF from OneDrive or from your device. 

### Finish editing

When done annotating, you can either:

-   Select **Stop editing**.

-   Select the live video feed in the corner of your screen.

### Make changes to your edits

To make changes to your edits, you can:

- While in edit mode, select **Undo** to undo the last action.

- While in edit mode, select **Erase all** (as seen here: ![Graphic showing the Erase icon, which looks like a trashcan.](media/3aab547aa81003ad181eceadc2c83a47.png "Erase all")) to erase all of the annotations made during that editing session.

- While in live mode, select **Erase all** (as seen here: ![Graphic showing the Erase icon, which looks like a trashcan.](media/3aab547aa81003ad181eceadc2c83a47.png "Erase all")) to erase all of the annotations made during that call.

> [!Note]
> - Specific drawings or arrows canâ€™t be removed.
> - Each call participant can only remove the annotations they added.

## Annotate 2D snapshot (only in a call with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile user)

Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile lets users take 2D snapshots of their environment and mixed reality annotations, and annotate them during a call. Snapshots are critical in situations where a still image might be needed to carefully add annotations to it. These snapshots can be used for reference later or work validation. Snapshots can also be utilized in low bandwidth situations.

When a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile user takes a snapshot, the video feed will freeze and you will see any annotations they add while they are in 2D snapshot mode. Start editing to begin adding annotations. After both call participants are finished annotating on the snapshot, the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile user selects the check mark to exit from the annotation mode and can choose to save the snapshot to their device's photo gallery.

Annotations are only displayed during the snapshot session. When the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile user exists snapshot mode, annotations from that snapshot session will be removed. 

For more information, [learn more about using snapshots](./mobile-app/annotate-snapshot.md).

## Share files  

You can share a OneDrive file or local file with a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist user. Supported files include .jpg, .bmp, .png, .tif/.tiff, .pdf, and still .gif.  

>[!Note] 
>You may want to show the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user a file that is not supported by the file sharing feature. For example, you may want to show a video and control when it plays and pauses, or you may want to show a PowerPoint and control which slide the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user can see. You can do so by sharing your desktop or application window. When you do so, a new slate appears in the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user's environment. 

**Share files with a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user**
- From the **Mixed Reality toolbar**, select the **Add file** option to share a file from OneDrive or your computer. The file will be uploaded in your personal OneDrive and permissions to access to that single file will be granted to call participants. Or, 
- From the Teams chat, select **Attach file** to share a file from OneDrive or your computer. 

Once the file is shared, it will pop up as a new slate in the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user's space and a link to the file will be shared in the chat. All call participants can annotate a file displayed in the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user's space.

> [!Note]
> After you share a file and it appears in the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user's space, you cannot move, delete, or resize the file.

**Share files with a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile user**
- From the Teams chat, select **Attach file** to share a file from OneDrive or your computer. When you share a file with a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile user, it will be sent in the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile text chat.

To access the file after the call: 
- Any call participant can find the link to the file in the Teams chat. 
- During the call, the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user can save the file to their OneDrive by tapping the OneDrive icon in the top-right corner of the slate. The file is then automatically saved to a OneDrive folder called "HoloLens Received Files." 

## Share your desktop or application window (with a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user only)

You may want to share your desktop or application window with a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user. This is useful if you'd like to communicate information that's not captured in a file type that is supported by the file sharing feature (that is, .jpg, .bmp, .png, .tif/.tiff, .pdf, and still .gif.). For example, you may want to share an instructional video that is playing in your browser, or a series of instructions embedded in a PowerPoint deck.  

To share your desktop or a running application:

1. Select the **Open share tray** icon.

   ![Screenshot of the share tray button](media/share-tray.PNG "Share tray button")
   
2. Select the application window you would like to share, or share your screen. 

> [!Note]
> You can only share one application window or screen at a time. If you want to share a different screen, select the **Close share tray** icon to stop sharing, select a different screen, and then start sharing again.

## Record a call

You may want to record the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call for documentation or record-keeping purposes. Read the comparison chart to understand the three options for recording a call. Then, keep reading to learn more about each option. 

### Comparison chart: Three ways to record a call 

| Recording type | What the recording captures|Who initiates the recording?|Pros |Cons |
|--|--|--|--|--|
|Create a cloud-based recording using Teams or Dynamics 365 Remote Assist|Teams desktop outgoing video feed (or avatar) and Dynamics 365 Remote Assist outgoing video feed (or avatar)| A Teams desktop user can only initiate a cloud-based recording in a group call or meeting. A Dynamics 365 Remote Assist user (HoloLens or mobile) can only initiate a cloud-based recording in a one-to-one call with a Teams desktop user. | Recording is automatically saved in Stream and link is available in Teams chat. If your admin has configured Field Service integration, you can post the recording link in a Field Service work order.| The layout of the recording depends on the number of call participants, and the layout cannot be configured. The recording captures the outgoing video feed (or avatar) of up to four call participants and the recording screen is divided evenly among the call participants. The Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens userâ€™s view never occupies the entire recording, and even if you primarily care about what the HoloLens user sees, you cannot adjust the recording layout to only capture what the HoloLens user sees. This may be confusing for a call with two participants (for example, one-to-one call or meeting with two participants); **during the call**, you will see a **horizontal** section of the HoloLens userâ€™s view, but because the Teams recording divides the recording screen into half, **in the call recording**, you will see a **vertical section** of the HoloLens userâ€™s view.|

### Create a cloud-based recording using Teams or Dynamics 365 Remote Assist

The comparison chart mentions that when you create a cloud-based recording using Teams, the recording screen is divided evenly among the call participants. Below are several examples.

#### Recording layout when call includes two participants

In a call recording with two participants, each participantâ€™s outgoing video (or avatar) occupies one half of the recording, and both halves are vertical. This means that during a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call, a Teams desktop user sees a horizontal slice of the HoloLens user's view, but the recording only captures the middle vertical slice of the HoloLens user's view. Furthermore, during the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call, the Teams desktop user only sees their outgoing video feed in the corner of the call, but in the recording, the Teams desktop user's outgoing video feed occupies half the recording. (If the Teams user turns off their outgoing video feed, their avatar will occupy half the recording.)

>[!Note] 
> To ensure that critical information is captured in the recording, the HoloLens user must keep it in the center of their view.

#### Recording layout when call includes three participants

In a recording with three participants, each participantâ€™s outgoing video (or avatar) occupies one third of the recording. During the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call, the Teams desktop user only sees their outgoing video feed in the corner of the call, but in the recording, the Teams desktop user's outgoing video feed occupies one third the recording. (If the Teams user turns off their outgoing video feed, their avatar will occupy one third of the recording.)

#### Recording layout when call includes four participants

In a recording with four participants, each participantâ€™s outgoing video (or avatar) occupies one fourth of the recording. During the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call, the Teams desktop user only sees their outgoing video feed in the corner of the call, but in the recording, the Teams desktop user's outgoing video feed occupies one fourth of the recording. (If the Teams user turns off their outgoing video feed, their avatar will occupy one fourth of the recording.)

#### Recording layout when call includes four or more participants

A recording including four or more participants splits the horizontal recording into four, with remaining participantsâ€™ avatars in the bottom-right corner of the recording.

#### How to initiate a cloud-based recording

If you're in a group call or meeting, go to the call controls. Select **More Options,** then select **Start recording.** A call recording ends if:
- You select **Stop recording**.
- Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call ends.

If you're in a one-to-one call, ask the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist user (HoloLens or mobile) to initiate the recording.

The person who initiates the recording owns the video. When a recording ends, it begins uploading to Microsoft Stream. Once the video is uploaded to Stream, the recorder receives an email notification, and all call participants can view a link to Stream via the Teams chat. The owner is the only participant who can [give permission](https://support.office.com/article/Play-and-share-a-meeting-recording-in-Teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa#bkmk_sharemeetingrecording) or [download the video](https://support.office.com/article/Play-and-share-a-meeting-recording-in-Teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa#bkmk_downloadmeetingrecording) to share the recording beyond these people. [Learn more about Stream video permissions]( https://docs.microsoft.com/stream/portal-permissions).

You can find all the videos you own [here]( https://msit.microsoftstream.com/studio/videos).

If your admin has configured Field Service integration, you can access the recording link and can post it in a Dynamics 365 Field Service work order.

### Record your Teams desktop screen using Windows Game bar

If it is imperative that your recording only captures as much of the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens userâ€™s view as possible, and as little of Teams userâ€™s outgoing videos (or avatars), consider recording your desktop screen using Windows Game Bar. 

#### How to initiate a recording of what the Teams Desktop user sees during the call 
1. Join a Remote Assist call using Teams desktop application

2. Press the **Windows logo key** (seen here: ![Graphic showing the windows logo key.](media/windows-logo-key.png)) + **G** to open the Game Bar.

   ![Screenshot showing the game bar.](media/game-bar.png)

3. Select the **Start Recording** button (or press **Windows logo key ![Windows logo key](media/windows-logo-key.png "Windows logo key") + Alt + R**).

   A small recording menu will appear that shows that the recording is in progress.
   
   ![Screenshot showing the recording menu.](media/recording.PNG "Recording")
   
4. To stop recording, select **Stop Recording**.

   The video of the recording will appear in your **Videos/Captures** folder.

## Send a text message 

During a call, participants can communicate through the text chat. The chat log will be available via Teams after the call ends.

From the call controls, select **Text Chat** (as seen here: ![Graphic showing the text chat icon.](media/Teams_Text.png)  to open the chat. The Dynamics 365 Remote Assist user can only see messages exchanged during the call, but you may see messages exchanged before the call. 

You can also attach a OneDrive or local file via the Teams chat **Attach file** feature.

>[!Note]
> Dynamics 365 Remote Assist chat supports certain formats, including bold, italic, strikethrough, and underline. It also supports hyperlinks. However, it does not support HTML-formatted or lists, such as a passage you copy and paste from a website. 
>
> For example, if you copy and paste text from a website that has HTML formatting and send it during a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call, the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user will see the text in the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist chat window, but the formatting may not be what you expect.

## File a support ticket
