## Optimize 3D models in SolidWorks 

The features in this tutorial have been identified as ways to optimize 3D models for use in mixed reality applications. Depending on how complex your model is, you may be able to just export it as a GLB file or you may need to use a combination of several features. 
 
## Remove features with the Simplify tool 

If your 3D model is extremely complex and you're having performance issues, you can optimize it with the Simplify tool.  The Simplify tool provides a wide range of options for simplifying your models to different levels, including internal part removal, small part removal, defeaturing and more.
