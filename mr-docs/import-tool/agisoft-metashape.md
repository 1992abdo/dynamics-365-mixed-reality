## Photography tips

The following tips will help you take quality photos for photogrammetry:

- If possible, take photos in a location where the lighting will remain consistent and does not cast shadows stark shadows

- If there are shadows cast, try to keep your own shadow out of the picture

- Avoid having moving objects in the background while taking photos

- If the camera you are using has HDR, turn this feature off and do not adjust the exposure of your photographs while you are capturing 
images

- Take pictures about 1 meter apart while circling the object

- If it is possible, maintain a perpendicular location to the model while you are taking photos

- If the subject is large, move in a lateral motion from one end of the object to the other changing the height with each pass until 
you feel that you have captured all of surfaces of the object
