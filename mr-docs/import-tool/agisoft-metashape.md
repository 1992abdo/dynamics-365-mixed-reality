## What is Agisoft Metashape?

Agisoft Metashape is a stand-alone software product that photogrammetrically processes digital images and generates 3D spatial 
data for use in Geographic Information System (GIS) applications, cultural heritage documentation, visual effects production, and indirect measurements of objects of various scales. [Learn more about Agisoft Metashape](https://www.agisoft.com/).

## Photography tips

The following tips will help you take quality photos for photogrammetry:

- If possible, take photos in a location where lighting is consistent and doesn't cast shadows.

- Try to keep your own shadow out of the picture.

- Make sure there are no moving objects in the background when you take the photos.

- If the camera you're using has a High Dynamic Range (HDR) setting, turn this feature off and try not to adjust the exposure of your photographs while capturing images.

- Take pictures about 1 meter apart while circling the object.

- If possible, maintain a perpendicular location to the object while taking photos.

- If the object is large, move in a lateral motion from one end of the object to the other, changing the height with each pass until 
you've captured all surfaces.

## Set preferences

For the most part, you can use the default preferences, but there are a few changes to make before getting started.

1. On the **Tools** menu, select **Preferences**.

    ![Tools > Preferences command](media/agisoft-1.PNG "Tools > Preferences command") 

2. On the **General** tab, under **Miscellaneous**, select the **Write log to file** check box, and then enter a location and filename for your log. Select **Apply** when you're done.

    ![General tab settings](media/agisoft-2.PNG "General tab settings")
 
3. On the **GPU** tab, select the check box for any available graphics processing units (GPUs). If you only have one GPU available, at the bottom of the dialog box, select the **Use CPU when performing GPU accelerated processing** check box. Select **Apply** when you're done.

    ![GPU tab settings](media/agisoft-3.PNG "GPU tab settings")
 
4. On the **Advanced** tab, under **Miscellaneous**, select the **Enable fine-level subdivision** and **Enable VBO support** check boxes. If the camera you're using has extensive meta data about location, orientation, and so on, you might want to experiment with the options in the **Export/Import** section. Select **OK** to apply the changes and close the **Metashape Preferences** dialog box.

## Import your photos

The first thing you need to do after setting up your preferences is to import the photos that Metashape will use to construct the 3D model.

- On the **Workflow** menu, select **Add Photos**, and then select the photos that you want to import.

    ![Workflow > Add Photos command](media/agisoft-5.PNG "Workflow > Add Photos command")
 
## Mask your photos

You can "mask out" irrelevant elements of your source photos that can be confusing to the program or that can lead to undesirable  results. You might want to do this from different angles in your pictures. Although it's not necessary to mask objects in every photo, the more photographs you mask, the more accurate the final result will be.

1.	Double-click an image to open it, choose a selection tool such as the **Intelligent scissors**, and then outline your 3D model subject.

    ![Intelligent Scissors tool](media/agisoft-6.PNG "Intelligent Scissors Tool")
 
2.	Select the **Add Selection** button to create the mask.

    ![Add selection button](media/agisoft-7.PNG "Add selection button")
 
3. Repeat this step in multiple pictures from multiple angles for best results.

    ![Refined model](media/agisoft-8.PNG "Refined model")

## Align the photos

Photogrammetry uses objects that are consistently present in multiple images to create a map of where it thinks the camera was when the photo was taken. You use the **Align photos** command for this part of the process.

1.	On the **Workflow** menu, select **Align Photos**.

    ![Workflow > Align Photos command](media/agisoft-9.PNG "Workflow > Align Photos command")
 
2.	In the **Align Photos** dialog box, use the default settings shown below, or change them as you see fit.  Select **OK** when you're done.

    ![Align Photos settings](media/agisoft-10.PNG "Align Photos settings")
 
3.	Select the **Model** menu to view the results. At this point, your model should look something like this.

    ![Photo alignment outcome](media/agisoft-11.PNG "Photo alignment outcome")
 
## Align the region

After aligning the photos, you can use the bounding box to trim the size of your 3D object. 

>[!NOTE]
>This step isn't required, but it speeds up the next steps.

1.	On the toolbar, select the **Resize Region** tool.

    ![Resize Region tool](media/agisoft-12.PNG "Resize Region tool")
 
2.	Drag the spheres at the edge of the region to select the area you want to convert.

    ![Selected area to convert](media/agisoft-13.PNG "Selected area to convert")

## Build a dense point cloud

Now it's time to build the dense point cloud.

1.	On the **Workflow** menu, select **Build Dense Cloud**.

    ![Workflow > Build Dense Cloud command](media/agisoft-14.PNG "Workflow > Build Dense Cloud command")
 
2.	In the **Build Dense Cloud** dialog box, use the following settings. Select **OK** when you're done.

    ![Build Dense Cloud settings](media/agisoft-15.PNG "Build Dense Cloud settings")
    
    >[!NOTE]
    >If you have a powerful computer, you can set the **Quality** setting to **High**, but for many operations the **Medium** setting produces quality results.  

## Build the mesh

Now it's time to build the mesh.

1.	On the **Workflow** menu, select **Build Mesh**.

    ![Workflow > Build Mesh command](media/agisoft-16.PNG "Workflow > Build Mesh command")
 
2.	In the **Build Mesh** dialog box, use the following settings.  

    ![Build Mesh settings](media/agisoft-17.PNG "Build Mesh settings")
    
    >[!NOTE]
    >You may want to change the **Face count** setting to match the [performance requirements for your targeted platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/mixed-reality/import-tool/optimize-models#performance-targets).
    
3. Select **OK** to convert the point cloud into a 3D model.
 
4. Examine the results, and then do one of the following:

    - If you're satisfied with the results, skip to the **Export your 3D model** procedure below. 
    
    - If you want a higher level of surface detail, go to the next procedure, **Build the texture**.  
    
    - If you don't like the shape of the object, you might want to add more masks to the areas that are missing details.

## Build the texture

Adding a texture map to your 3D model can significantly increase the visual fidelity while maintaining performance. 

>[!NOTE]
>This step is optional.  

1.	On the **Workflow** menu, select **Build Texture**.

    ![Workflow > Build Texture command](media/agisoft-18.PNG "Workflow > Build Texture command")

2.	Use the following default values. Select **OK** when you're done.

    ![Build Texture settings](media/agisoft-19.PNG "Build Texture settings")
    
    >[!NOTE]
    >You might want to consider reducing the texture size depending on the platform you're targeting.  

## Export the 3D model

The final step is to convert the model to a GLB file format so you can use it in Dynamics 365 mixed-reality applications.

1. On the **File** menu, select **Export**, select **Export Model**, and then choose a name and location for the 3D model.

    ![File > Export > Export Model command](media/agisoft-20.PNG "File > Export > Export Model command")

2. In the **Save as type** field, select **.glb**, and then select **Save**.

    ![Save As dialog box](media/agisoft-21.PNG "Save As dialog box")
 
3. In the **Export Model** dialog box, for the **Export texture** option, select **PNG** (recommended) and leave the other default values.

    ![Export Model settings](media/agisoft-22.PNG "Export Model settings")
    
4. Select **OK**.
 
    The model is done and ready to use in Dynamics 365 mixed-reality applications.
