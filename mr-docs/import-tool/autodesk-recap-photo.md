# Use Autodesk Recap Photo to create 3D models for mixed reality using photogrammetry

This tutorial will walk you through the process of using Autodesk’s Recap Photo photogrammetry software to create 3D models that 
can be used with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Mixed Reality applications.

## What is Autodesk Recap Photo?

Autodesk Recap Photo processes photographs (taken from drones) to create 3D representations of current conditions of sites, objects, 
and more. -[Autodesk Recap Photo](https://www.autodesk.com/products/recap/overview)

## Photography tips

The following tips will help you take quality photos for photogrammetry:

- If possible, take photos in a location where the lighting will remain consistent and does not cast shadows

- If there are shadows, try to keep your own shadow out of the picture

- Avoid having moving objects in the background while taking photos

- If the camera you are using has HDR, turn this feature off and try not to adjust the exposure of your photographs while you are 
capturing images

- Take pictures about 1 meter apart while circling the subject

- If it is possible, maintain a perpendicular location to the subject while you are taking photos

- If the subject is large, move in a lateral motion from one end of the object to the other changing the height with each pass 
until you feel that you have captured all surfaces.

## Start a new project

After launching Autodesk Recap Photo, you will see the dashboard.  You can choose either “Aerial” or “Object” to create a new 
3D project.  This tutorial will cover the **Object** workflow.

1.	Click the **Object** option from the “Create 3D” menu.
 
SCREEN SHOT GOES HERE.

2.	You will be prompted to click anywhere to add photos.  Click anywhere and then add the photos that you wish to use to create 
your 3D model.  Once you have your photos imported, click **Create**.

SCREEN SHOT GOES HERE.
 
3.	This will open the settings menu for creating your photogrammetry project.  You can use the Autocrop feature here if you would 
like, but for this tutorial we will leave it unchecked and wait to crop the 3D model later.  Autodesk Recap Photo uses “Cloud Credits” 
to provide photogrammetry services.  This section of the menu will show you how many cloud credits you have, and how many it will 
take to process these photographs.  You can learn more about Autodesk’s Cloud credits here. https://aka.ms/autodesk_cloud_credits.  
Give your project a name and click start to process your photos.  This process will take some time, based on the number of photos, 
and your connection to the internet.

4.	Once your 3D model has been processed, it will appear in the “My Cloud Drive” section of the dashboard.  Click the **Download 
this project from the cloud** icon button to retrieve your 3d model.

5.	Choose a location to save your model and click **Save Folder**.
 
SCREEN SHOT GOES HERE.

6.	You will now see a new 3D model with the name that you selected earlier.  Click on the object to open it in the Editor.
