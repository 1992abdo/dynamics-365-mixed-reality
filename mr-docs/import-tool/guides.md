# Work with Dynamics 365 Guides

The 3D models prepared with the Import Tool can be used in Dynamics 365 Guides. To import them, youâ€™ll need to locate the 3D model file and place it using the Guides PC authoring app.

Files created with the Import Tool are stored locally in C:\Users\[username]\3D Objects\Microsoft Layout. 

To find the files on your local drive using the Import Tool user interface:

1.	Open the Import Tool.

2.	Right-click the model, and then select **Open file location**.  

    ![Locate file](media/locate-model.PNG "Locate file") 
  
3.	Browse to this location when you're ready to [import your own custom 3D objects in the PC authoring app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/pc-authoring#import).
