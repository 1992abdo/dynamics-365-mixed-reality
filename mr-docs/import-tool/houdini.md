# Use SideFx Houdini to prepare 3D models for use in Dynamics 365 mixed reality applications

This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions that will show you how to:

- Optimize a 3D model by reducing the polygon count so that it matches [performance targets for Dynamics 365 mixed 
reality applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/import-tool/optimize-models#performance-targets).  

- Add the correct material to a 3D model. 

- Export an optimized 3d model as a .GLB file that can be used in Dynamics 365 mixed reality applications. 

- Create a processing pipeline template for quickly optimizing other 3D models in the future.
