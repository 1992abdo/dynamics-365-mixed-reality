# Overview of self-serve tutorials

3D models come in all shapes and sizes. Sometimes they're complex and require preparation before you can use them in mixed reality scenarios. To make it easier to prepare your 3D models, we created tutorials for several third-party CAD (Computer-Aided Design) and DCC (Digital Content Creation) programs. 

The goal of these tutorials isn't to teach you to be an expert at using these programs. The goal is to guide you through the process of preparing your 3D models so you can achieve more with mixed reality. 

## CAD tutorials 

If you use Autodesk Inventor or Dassault SolidWorks, there are built-in tools that can simplify complex components and make your 3D models perform better in mixed reality. Start with these tutorials to produce the highest-quality 3D models: 

Autodesk Inventor 

Dassault SolidWorks 

## DCC tutorials 

If your 3D models are in FBX, OBJ, or GLB file format, you can use either of the following tutorials to prepare your 3D models: 

SideFX Houdini 

Blender 

If your models are in some other file format, or if you already have access to 3ds Max, you can use the following tutorial to prepare your 3D models: 

Autodesk 3ds Max
