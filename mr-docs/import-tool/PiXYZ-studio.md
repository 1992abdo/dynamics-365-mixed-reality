## Use PiXYZ Studio to prepare 3D models for use in Dynamics 365 mixed-reality apps

This tutorial outlines a general process for using PiXYZ software to convert Computer-Aided Design (CAD) based parametric assets into polygon-based .GLB files that perform 
well in Dynamics 365 mixed-reality apps (see [Optimize your 3D models](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/import-tool/optimize-models#performance-targets) for information about performance targets). Keep in mind that every asset and use case ise different, 
so you may need to adjust the process accordingly.
