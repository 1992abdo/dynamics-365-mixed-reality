# Tutorial 1: Using Blender to prepare 3D models for use in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Mixed Reality applications

This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions that show you how to:

- Reduce the polygon count of a 3D model so that it matches the performance needs specific to the [performance targets for Dynamics 
365 mixed reality applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/import-tool/optimize-models#performance-targets).

- Combine the 3D model’s multiple materials (colors) into a single texture that can be applied to the model.

- Export the optimized 3D model as a [GLB](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/import-tool/#gltf-and-glb-file-formats) file that can be used in Dynamics 365 mixed reality applications.

The combination of reducing polygons and turning multiple materials into a single texture can transform a complex 3D model that 
is resource intensive, into a highly performant 3D model that performs well in mixed reality applications.
