MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS     

MICROSOFT .NET LIBRARY     

These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. 
Please read them. They apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms also 
apply to any Microsoft   

- Updates, 

- Supplements, 

- Internet-based services, and  

- Support services  

for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.   

BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.   

IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE PERPETUAL RIGHTS BELOW.   

1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.   

>a. Installation and Use. You may install and use any number of copies of the software to design, develop and test your programs.

2. DATA. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may 
use this information to improve our products and services. You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation 
and the privacy statement at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=528096. Your use of the software operates as your consent 
to these practices.    

3. ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.     

>a. DISTRIBUTABLE CODE. The software is comprised of Distributable Code. âDistributable Codeâ is code that you are permitted to

>>>- You may copy and distribute the object code form of the software.  

>>>- Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your programs to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of 
those programs.  

>>ii. Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute, you must   

>>>- Add significant primary functionality to it in your programs;  

>>>- Require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect it at least as much as this agreement;  

>>>- Display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and  

>>>- Indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneysâ fees, related to the distribution or use of 
your programs.  

>>iii. Distribution Restrictions.  You may not 

>>>- Alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Distributable Code;  

>>>- Use Microsoftâs trademarks in your programsâ names or in a way that suggests your programs come from or are endorsed by Microsoft; 

>>>- Include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful programs; or  

>>>- Modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An 
Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution, that  

>>>- The code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or  

>>>- Others have the right to modify it.  

4. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft 
reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as 
expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow 
you to use it in certain ways. You may not  

- Work around any technical limitations in the software;  

- Reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits,

internal, reference purposes.  

7. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic 
and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users 
and end use. For additional information, see  www.microsoft.com/exporting. 

8. SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is âas is,â we may not provide support services for it.  

9. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, 
are the entire agreement for the software and support services.  

10. APPLICABLE LAW.  

>a. United States. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement 
and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all 
other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.  

>b. Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.   

11. LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. 
You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your 
rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.  

12. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED âAS-IS.â YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, 
GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS OR STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT 
CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS 
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.   

>FOR AUSTRALIA â YOU HAVE STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW AND NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE 
RIGHTS.   

13. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO 
U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.   

This limitation applies to 

- Anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and  

- Claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent 
permitted by applicable law.  

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may 
not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.  

Please note: As this software is distributed in Quebec, Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.  

Remarque: Ce logiciel Ã©tant distribuÃ© au QuÃ©bec, Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en franÃ§ais.  

EXONÃRATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel visÃ© par une licence est offert Â« tel quel Â». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est Ã  votre seule 
risque et pÃ©ril. Microsoft nâaccorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez bÃ©nÃ©ficier de droits additionnels en vertu du droit 
local sur la protection des consommateurs, que ce contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises par le droit locale, 
les garanties implicites de qualitÃ© marchande, dâadÃ©quation Ã  un usage particulier et dâabsence de contrefaÃ§on sont exclues.  

LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÃRÃTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÃ POUR LES DOMMAGES. Vous  pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses 
fournisseurs une indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement Ã  hauteur de 5,00 $ US. Vous ne pouvez prÃ©tendre Ã  aucune 
indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y compris les dommages spÃ©ciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de bÃ©nÃ©fices.  

Cette limitationconcerne: 

- Tout ce qui est reliÃ© au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y compris le code) figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des 
programmes tiers ; et  

- Les rÃ©clamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou au titre de responsabilitÃ© stricte, de nÃ©gligence ou dâune 
autre faute dans la limite autorisÃ©e par la loi en vigueur.  

Elle sâapplique Ã©galement, mÃªme si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaÃ®tre lâÃ©ventualitÃ© dâun tel dommage. Si votre pays nâautorise 
pas lâexclusion ou la limitation de responsabilitÃ© pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se 
peut que la limitation ou lâexclusion ci-dessus ne sâappliquera pas Ã  votre Ã©gard.  

EFFET JURIDIQUE.   Le prÃ©sent contrat dÃ©crit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir dâautres droits prÃ©vus par les lois de 
votre pays. Le prÃ©sent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confÃ¨rent les lois de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.
