# Rename a guide in Dynamics 365 Guides

You can rename a guide created in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides from the **Home** screen in the PC app. 

1. Sign in to the PC app with your author credentials.

2. In the **Home** screen, find the guide you want to rename, right-click it, and then select **Rename**.     

   >[!NOTE]
   >If you opened the guide recently it should appear on the **Recent** tab. Otherwise, select the **All** tab to view the complete list of guides.

3. In the **Rename guide** dialog box, enter the new name, and then select **OK**. Dynamics 365 Guides files have a maximum limit of 58 characters. 

   The name is immediately updated for all users. 

   >[!NOTE]
   >Since the position of guides on the **Recent** tab is based on how recently you opened a file, the position will not change on 
   the tab until you open the renamed file. On the **All** tab, guides are ordered alphabetically, so the position may update 
   on that tab.
