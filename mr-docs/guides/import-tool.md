# Convert 3D models to use as holograms in Dynamics 365 Guides

[!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] lets you create and import your own custom 3D parts by using your own 3D models. [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] supports glTF, GLB, STL, FBX, and PLY file formats. You can use a combination of third-party tools to prepare your 3D models.
