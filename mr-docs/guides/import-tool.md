# Use the Dynamics 365 Import Tool (Preview) with Dynamics 365 Guides

With [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)], you can create and import your own custom 3D parts by using computer-aided design (CAD) models. [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] supports glTF, GLB, STL, and PLY file formats. You can use a combination of third-party tools and the [!include[pn-dyn-365-import-tool](../includes/pn-dyn-365-import-tool.md)] to prepare your 3D (CAD) models. For more information about the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)], see these topics:
