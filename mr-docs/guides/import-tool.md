# Use the Dynamics 365 Import Tool with Dynamics 365 Guides in preview

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]
 
Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides in preview supports glTF, GLB, and FBX file formats. For additional file support (including some CAD formats) and automated 3D model optimization, you can use the Dynamics 365 Import Tool (Preview) available through Dynamics 365 Layout. You can also see up a free 90-day trial of the Import Tool. To learn more about the Import Tool, see [Import Tool overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/mixed-reality/import-tool).
