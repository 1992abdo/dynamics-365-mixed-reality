With Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides, you can create and import your own custom 3D parts using CAD models. Dynamics 365 Guides supports glTF, GLB, and FBX file formats. You can use a combination of third-party tools and the Dynamics 365 Import Tool (Preview) to prepare your 3D (CAD) models, or you can use the Import Toolâ€™s concierge service to have Microsoft convert and optimize the models for you. For more information on the Import Tool, see these topics:
