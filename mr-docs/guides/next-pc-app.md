# What's next after creating a guide in the Dynamics 365 PC app?

After you create your guide on the PC, select an anchoring method, and create your tasks and steps, you’re ready to [test things out on HoloLens in a real-world environment, and place your holograms](hololens-authoring.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When switching between PC and [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], be sure to select **Refresh** when starting work on a device to ensure that you have the latest version of the guide. 

Don’t worry if your guide isn’t perfect before switching to [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] authoring. You can always go back to the PC application to edit and restructure your guide. In fact, we’ve found it’s generally a good idea to do a quick test of the flow on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], and then go back to the PC application to make changes before placing all your holograms in [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)].

> [!TIP]
> If you’re creating multiple versions of the same guide, you might want to use the **Save a Copy** command on the **File** menu. This is great for guides that are similar but have a few different steps. You don’t have to start from scratch!
