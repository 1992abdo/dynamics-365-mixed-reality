# Customization tutorial 1: Automatically generate Dynamics 365 Guides deeplinks to use in an Excel link manager

This tutorial shows you how to create a link manager for your guides in Microsoft Excel to easily keep track of your guides. You can use the list manager to quickly launch a guide in the PC app link or in the HoloLens app by using the QR code link. The same workflow could be used for other scenarios like adding a link to a guide in an approval flow, embedding QR codes with links to guides in a work order, or in a learning management system.

The Excel spreadsheet created through this tutorial will look like this:
