# Overview of operating a guide in Dynamics 365 Guides

[Watch a video on operating a guide](https://aka.ms/guidesoperate)

Welcome to [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)]! This set of topics is designed to help operators understand how to use a holographic guide created with [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)]. It describes everything that you, as the operator, need to know about the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] user interface and how to accomplish tasks in a real-world environment, such as a busy factory floor. If youâ€™re like other first-line workers in this type of environment, you probably have your hands full of tools and parts as you do your work. With [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)], you can stay heads-up and keep your tools in your hands as you follow step-by-step holographic instructions to accomplish your tasks.

>If you're a Dynamics 365 Guides administrator, you can assign a role so operators can view guides but not edit them. For more information, see [Assign an Author or Operator role to a user](assign-role.md).
