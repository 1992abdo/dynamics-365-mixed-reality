# Overview of analyzing guides created with Dynamics 365 Guides 

When operators use the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app in Operate mode, data about guide usage is automatically stored in your private and secure Dynamics 365 environment. This  operations data, which includes information about time spent on each step and whether an operator completed a guide, is stored in Microsoft Dataverse tables just like your Dynamics Guides content. These tables make it easy to analyze guide usage across your organization, gain insights into process efficiency, or trigger workflows outside of Dynamics 365 Guides.  

Dynamics 365 Guides also comes with [Guides Analytics Power BI templates](analytics-guide.md) populated with Dynamics 365 Guides session data stored securely in your Dynamics 365 environment. You can use these templates to analyze the usage of guides across your organization.  

> [!NOTE]
> Guides operations data is intended to help supervisors and managers derive insights regarding operational efficiencies and usage of Dynamics 365 Guides. This feature is not intended for use in making (and should not be used to make) decisions that affect the employment of an employee or group of employees, including compensation, rewards, seniority, or other rights or entitlements. Customers are solely responsible for using Dynamics 365, this feature, and any associated feature or service in compliance with all applicable laws, including laws relating to accessing individual employee analytics and monitoring. Customers are encouraged to have a mechanism in place to inform their users that analytics relating to their guides usage is collected.
