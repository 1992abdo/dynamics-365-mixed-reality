# Overview of analyzing guides created with Dynamics 365 Guides 

When operators use the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app in Operate mode, data about guide usage is automatically stored in your private and secure Dynamics 365 environment. This  operations data, which includes information about time spent on each step and whether an operator completed a guide, is stored in Microsoft Dataverse tables just like your Dynamics Guides content. These tables make it easier than ever to analyze guide usage across your organization, gain insights into process efficiency, or trigger workflows outside of Dynamics 365 Guides.  

Guides Analytics is part of the  Dynamics 365 Guides application suite that includes the Dynamics 365 Guides PC authoring app and the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app. Use Guides Analytics to analyze the usage of guides across your organization. Guides Analytics consists of Power BI visual reports that are populated with Dynamics 365 Guides session data stored securely in your Dynamics 365 environment.
