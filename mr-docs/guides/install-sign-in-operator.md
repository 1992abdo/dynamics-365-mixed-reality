# Install and sign in to the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app (operators)

1.	Make sure you have [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] build 10.0.14393.0 or later installed on your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] device. We recommend updating to newer versions when available. See [Manage updates to HoloLens](https://docs.microsoft.com/HoloLens/hololens-updates) for instructions on using [!include[pn-ms-windows-short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] Update for Business.

2.	On your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] device, use the [bloom gesture](authoring-gestures.md) to open the **Home** menu, and then open the [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] Store app and search for “[!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)]”.

3.	Select **Install** to download and install the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] application.

## Sign in to the HoloLens app

If you sign in with a brand new [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] device, you’ll be prompted to walk through the Setup wizard. In the Setup wizard, you can sign in with an existing account or create a new one, depending on the version of [!include[pn-ms-windows-short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] that you’re running. The Setup wizard also walks you through steps to calibrate and prepare [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)]. For more information on calibration, see the “First things first” section of this topic.

>[!NOTE]
>If you're a Dynamics 365 Guides administrator, you can assign the **Operator** role to operators so they can view guides but not edit them. If you assign the **Operator** role to a user, they can also skip the **Select Mode** dialog box step and open a guide directly. For more information, see [Assign an Author or Operator role to a user](assign-role.md).
