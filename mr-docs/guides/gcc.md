In response to the unique and evolving requirements of the United States public sector, Microsoft has created Dynamics 365 Guides US Government, a plan for US government 
organizations. We recommend that you read this supplementary section alongside the [Guides documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/), which covers information about the Guides Government 
Community Cloud (GCC) service description. 

At this time, Dynamics 365 Guides is offered only at the Government Community Cloud (GCC) level. It is currently unavailable for GCC High, and for the Department of Defense 
(DoD).  

The Dynamics 365 Guides US Government service description is designed to serve as an overlay to the general Dynamics 365 Guides service description. It defines the unique commitments of this service and the differences from Dynamics 365 Guides offerings.

## What is customer data and customer content?

Customer data, as defined in the Online Services Terms, means all data, including all text, sound, video, 3D models, or image files, and software, that are provided to 
Microsoft by, or on behalf of, customers through the use of the Online Service. Customer content refers to a specific subset of customer data that has been directly 
created by users, such as content stored in databases through entries in [Common Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro) entities (for example, 3D models). Content is generally considered 
confidential information and in normal service operation is not sent over the internet without encryption.

Microsoft reminds you not to share any controlled, sensitive, or confidential information with support personnel as part of your Dynamics 365 Guides GCC-related support 
incident, until you confirm their authorization to view or access such data. Microsoft is committed to protecting your privacy. Dynamics 365 Guides Customer Support 
is not included in the service accreditation boundary and does not provide FedRAMP, CJIS, IRS 1075, DISA SRG L2 data handling and/or compliance assurances.

For more information on Dynamics 365 Guides protection of customer data, see the [Microsoft Online Services Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/product-overview).
