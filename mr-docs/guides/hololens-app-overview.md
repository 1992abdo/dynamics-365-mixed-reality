# Overview of authoring a guide in the the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app

![Video camera graphic](media/video-camera.PNG "Video camera graphic") [Watch a video on HoloLens authoring](https://aka.ms/hololensauthor)

The second major step in authoring a guide in [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] takes place on the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] application. In [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] Author mode, you:

- Anchor your guide.

- Place your holographic 3D content in its relevant space in the real world.

- Add dotted lines to visually tie your steps to physical objects in the real world.

- Add styles (optional) to 3D content to add treatments such as a warning or caution.

- Test the flow of your guide.

>[!TIP]
>**New for [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] 2.** [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] now includes [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] 2 advanced hand-tracking capabilities. When you author a guide, you can now work directly with holograms by grabbing the manipulation controls with your hands to position, rotate, and change the size. When selecting a guide, scanning an anchor, or working in the Step card editor, however, you make selections the same way as on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] 1.<br>Watch this space for future developments on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] 2 hand tracking in [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)]!
