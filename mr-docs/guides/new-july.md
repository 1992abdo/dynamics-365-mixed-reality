## What's new in Dynamics 365 Guides (July 9, 2019)

Guides app version 103.1907.04001.0 brings a new look and feel to the PC and HoloLens apps. We improved the user experience and aligned it with the Dynamics 365 family of apps. 
 
### Improvements in this release

- The PC app is now fully responsive across various screen sizes. 

- The navigation menu on the left and bottom right of the PC app makes it much faster to navigate between guide content and guide anchor settings. 
 
- “Gaze-dwell” interactions on HoloLens are consistently placed on the left side of list items to make it easier to select while browsing. 

- 3D models are loaded for each step to improve performance on HoloLens.
 
This **What's New** panel will continue to inform you of new and noteworthy features in each monthly release.
