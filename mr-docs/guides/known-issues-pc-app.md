# Known issues with the Dynamics 365 Guides PC app

## I can't find the guide I created

Look for newly created guides in the **All** tab in the list of guides. The **Recents** list shows only those guides that have been previously opened on the device and does not include any guide recently created in the PC authoring application. 

## I don't see any guides in the Guides list

If you don't see any guides, either your internet connection is unstable, or you might have signed into an instance that doesn't have any guides. First, check your internet connection. If you're connected, try signing in again, but this time make sure you sign into the instance that has the guides you were looking for. If you still don't see any guides, contact your administrator.

## Keep file names for 3D models and media short

Before you upload custom 3D models or media files in the PC app, please make sure the file names are not more than 60 characters, and do not contain special characters (&, @, and so on). 

Large 3D models are stored in [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] memory while in use; therefore, the experience is significantly slower if there are too many models in a guide. **For reasonable performance, we recommend that you don't exceed 450 MB of 3D models in a single guide.** 

## You can create guides with the same name without overwriting old guides

You can create multiple guides with the same name. While this prevents unintentional overwrites of old files, it's confusing when you choose a guide from a list. When you create a new guide, make sure to use a unique name.

## 3D content and media cannot be renamed or deleted from the PC app after uploading

At this time, we do not support renaming or deleting 3D content and media once they have been uploaded to the server. While it's possible to rename them in [!include[pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)], doing so can have unintended consequences on any guides that use this content.

## 3D content and media will be overwritten if you upload new content with the same name

We do not support multiple files with the same name in the current release. When uploading new 3D models or media, check to make sure a file with the same name does not exist in the library. You can, however, have different types of files with the same nameâ€”for example, a bolt.png image and a bolt.glb 3D model.

## Can't use the same name for 3D parts that you upload, even if they have different extensions

The app currently looks up media by file names. So, for example, if you have a picture.jpg file and a picture.png, the app doesn't know which file to show for the step. So it's best to always use unique file names for media files you upload.

## I don't see media or 3D content that I uploaded to the app

When you upload content, at this time, the app doesn't automatically scroll to the place in the library where the content is uploaded. To find the content, go to the library (right side of the screen), and then select the appropriate tab (**3D parts**, **Pictures**, **Videos**, or **3D toolkit**).

The PC app shows notifications (in the top title bar) if there are any errors during uploading. Check to make sure your content is in the right file format. [Learn about supported file formats for Dynamics 365 Guides](create-steps-assign-media.md#what-file-formats-are-supported-for-3d-models-images-and-videos). 

If you still can't find your content, contact your administrator.

## Deleting an asset from a step (from the bin) in the PC app will remove all previously placed instances on HoloLens

If you're editing an existing guide, where an asset was placed in a bin in the PC app, and then instances of that asset were placed in the world on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], note that deleting the asset from the bin removes all of the placed assets in space. Adding the asset again will not restore the placed instances. To restore, press the **Undo** button in the PC app to revert the change.

## Uploading glTF files with dependencies across different folders might result in upload errors

Some glTF files may have dependencies in other folders that the app may not have permissions to when uploading. This might result in errors or broken 3D models in the gallery. Please make sure you either have permissions to all dependencies, or that you have all of them in the same folder when uploading glTF models.
