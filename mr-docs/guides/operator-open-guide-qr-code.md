# Open a guide in Dynamics 365 Guides by using a QR code (for operators)

You can open a guide in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides by scanning a QR code that includes an embedded link to a guide. This can be a printed QR code or a digital QR code 
included in a digital document. 

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is available only on HoloLens 2.
 
## Open a guide by scanning a QR code

1. On your HoloLens, go to [mixed reality home](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens2-basic-usage#start-menu-mixed-reality-home-and-apps). This is the first thing you seen when you first start HoloLens.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you're not sure if you're at mixed reality home, [open the **Start** menu](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens2-basic-usage#start-menu-mixed-reality-home-and-app), and then look for the **Home** button at the bottom of the menu. If the **Start** menu doesn't have a **Home** button, you're already at mixed reality home.

    > [!NOTE] 
    > If you haven't previously signed into the account and tenant, you'll be prompted to do so. If the account has both Author and Operator permissions, you'll be asked to choose which mode you want to open the guide in. If you only have Operator permissions, it automatically launches the guide in Operator mode.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you open a guide by using a QR code with an embedded link, the guide isn't automatically anchored. After you open the guide, you have to anchor it using the anchor
    provided by the author of the guide. After you anchor the guide for the first time, it will remember itâ€™s spatial position the next time you open it, however. 
    If it remembers your anchor alignment, you will still need to confirm it's in the correct position. [Learn more about anchoring a guide](operator-anchor.md).
