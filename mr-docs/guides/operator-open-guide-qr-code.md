You can open a guide in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides by scanning a QR code from the Microsoft HoloLens **Home** menu. This can be a printed QR code or a digital QR code 
in a digital document.

## Open a guide by scanning a QR code

1. On your HoloLens, go to [the mixed reality home](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens2-basic-usage#start-menu-mixed-reality-home-and-apps). 

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you're not sure if you're at mixed reality home, [open the **Start** menu](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens2-basic-usage#start-menu-mixed-reality-home-and-app), and
then look for the **Home** button at the bottom of the menu. If the **Start** menu doesn't have a **Home** button, you're already at mixed reality home.

2. Gaze at the QR code.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you open a guide by using a QR code with an embedded link, the guide is not automatically anchored. After you open the guide, you have to anchor it using the anchor
    provided by the author of the guide. After you anchor your guide for the first time, it will remember itâ€™s spatial position the next time you open it, however. 
    If it remembers your anchor alignment, you will still need to confirm it is in the correct position. [Learn more about anchoring a guide](operator-anchor.md).
