# Find a guide with the HoloLens app (HoloLens 2 only) for Dynamics 365 Guides

If you have access to a long list of guides created with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides, you can use this procedure to quickly find the guide you're looking for.

1.	In the **Guides** dialog box, gaze at the magnifying glass until the holographic keyboard appears.   

2.	Type the characters for the guide you're looking for. As you start to type the characters, the list is automatically filtered to guides that match the characters 
included anywhere in the guide name.

4.	To open a guide from the results, gaze at the selection box for the guide you want to open.

5.	To refine the criteria, gaze at the magnifying glass again or tap the text box that shows the filter text.

6.	To exit search and return to the main guides list, gaze at the **Back** button.
