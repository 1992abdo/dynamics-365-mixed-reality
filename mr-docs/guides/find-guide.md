# Find a guide to use in the HoloLens app (HoloLens 2 only) for Dynamics 365 Guides

If you have access to a long list of guides created with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides, you can use the search button and the holographic keyboard to find it fast.

1.	In the **Select guide** dialog box, gaze at the magnifying glass until the holographic keyboard appears.

2.	Type the characters for the guide you're looking for. As you start to type the characters, the list is automatically filtered to guides that match the characters 
included anywhere in the guide name.
