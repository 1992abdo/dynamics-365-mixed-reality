# Use Follow mode and pinning in the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app

You'll notice that, wherever you look, the Step card follows your gaze in the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app. While you're working, you never have to worry about where your instructions are. You can stop the Step card from following you by turning off **Follow** mode from the navigation bar.

You can also grab the navigation bar at any time to place the card where you want it.
