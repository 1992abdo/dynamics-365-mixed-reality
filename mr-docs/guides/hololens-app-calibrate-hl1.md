# Calibrate your HoloLens 1 device for authoring in the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app

[!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] uses holograms to show what operators 
need to do to perform a real-world task. For example, a guide that you author might show an operator how to assemble a door for a commercial aircraft. It's very 
important that both you and your operators calibrate your HoloLens display for your own eyes so that holograms are properly displayed and perceived as accurately 
positioned in space. Otherwise, your operator might drill a hole in the wrong place or assemble the wrong part. 

To make sure that holograms are correctly aligned, you must calibrate your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] device before authoring a guide. 
You can complete this step by using the Calibration app that comes with your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)].
