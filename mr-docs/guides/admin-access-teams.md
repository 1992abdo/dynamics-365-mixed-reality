# Use access teams to limit access to guides and guides content in Dynamics 365 Guides

A Microsoft Dynamics 365 administrator can use [access teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/use-access-teams-owner-teams-collaborate-share-information) 
to easily customize who can see specific guides and guides content (3D models, images, or videos) in Dynamics 365 Guides. Access teams 
are useful when you want to grant different user permissions for specific records in [Common Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro). 
For example, you might want to limit access of certain guides to a specific factory location, or limit access to guides that are in progress.

>[!NOTE]
>Dynamics 365 offers additional ways to customize and configure access to specific records in Common Data Service. Advanced 
configuration, such as the creation of [Owner teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/use-access-teams-owner-teams-collaborate-share-information), 
is not covered in this topic.
