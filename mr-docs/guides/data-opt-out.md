# Opt out of storing Dynamics 365 Guides usage data in Common Data Service

Dynamics 365 Guides apps enable teams to capture usage statistics and detailed time-tracking information. This data is used to 
provide metrics for operator performance and help you identify opportunities for process optimization. Administrators can turn off 
data collection for specific users if they like. 

To do this:

1.	Go to powerapps.microsoft.com and sign in with your admin account.

2.	In the tenant/instance drop-down, select the instance that has Dynamics 365 Guides installed.

3.	Select the Guides app in the list. This opens a new tab for the Guides portal.

4.	In the left navigation, go to **User Settings.**
