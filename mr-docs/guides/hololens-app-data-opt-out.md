# Opt out of sending telemetry data to Microsoft in the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app

For privacy reasons, you can turn off the ability to send telemetry data to Microsoft in the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] HoloLens app. Microsoft uses this data to improve the product. Opting out prevents Microsoft from collecting any activity data.

To turn telemetry data off for HoloLens:

- In **Settings**, turn the **Send Usage Data** slider to off.

    ![Send Usage Data setting](media/send-usage-data.PNG "Send Usage Data setting")
    
> [!NOTE]
> This option applies only to the device on which it's set. If you use [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] on more than one device, you need to modify the setting on those other devices. To turn this setting off for the PC application, see [Author a guide in the PC application](pc-app-overview.md).
