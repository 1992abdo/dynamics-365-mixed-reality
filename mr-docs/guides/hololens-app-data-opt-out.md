For privacy reasons, you can turn off the ability to send telemetry data to Microsoft. Microsoft uses this data to improve the product. Opting out prevents Microsoft from collecting any activity data.

To turn telemetry data off for HoloLens:

- In **Settings**, turn the **Send Usage Data** slider to off.

> This option applies only to the device on which it's set. If you use Dynamics 365 Guides on more than one device, you need to modify the setting on those other devices. To turn this setting off for the PC application, see [Author a guide in the PC application](pc-authoring.md).
