# Use voice commands on HoloLens 2 in Dynamics 365 Guides

You can use voice commands in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides as a form of input instead of hand gestures or gaze. Most voice commands 
are contextual; they only work in certain areas of the user interface.  

>[!NOTE]
> Voice commands are not supported on HoloLens 1. For HoloLens 2, voice commands are supported in the following languages: English, Spanish, German, Dutch, French, Italian, 
Japanese, Korean and Chinese. The voice commands you use are consistent with the HoloLens OS display language. To view your display language, go to 
**Settings** > **Time and Language** > **Language**. 

## Provide permission for Dynamics 365 Guides to use the microphone

When you first install Dynamics 365 Guides, the app asks for permission to use the microphone.

Voice commands won't work unless you provide this permission. If you didn't provide this permission when you installed the app, you 
can change them in **Settings** > **Privacy** >, **Microphone**.
