# Setup Step 1: Buy a Dynamics 365 Guides subscription or sign up for a free trial subscription

>[!NOTE]
>Before completing this step, make sure to see [Overview of setting up Dynamics 365 Guides](setup.md)

There are multiple ways to get a [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] subscription:

- If you have a Microsoft work account, you can go directly to the Microsoft 365 admin center and search for a [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] subscription there.

- Go to the [Getting started](https://aka.ms/GetGuides) page. You can use this page to buy a subscription or to sign up for a free, 30-day trial subscription. If you sign up for a trial, you can use credentials for an existing Dynamics 365 account or you can create new credentials. 

    > [!IMPORTANT] 
    > If you don't have administrator permissions associated with your work account, you won't be able to complete step 2 of the Setup process. Please coordinate setup with your administrator. If it's not possible to coordinate setup with your administrator, you can choose to create user credentials to try out [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] by following the steps on the [Getting started](https://aka.ms/GetGuides) page. In this case, the new tenant will be created and the newly created user account will have administrator permissions. Note that you'll need to provide the domain name in the form: *guidesYourCompanyName*

## Assign the Dynamics 365 Guides license to user accounts

After you sign up for a [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] subscription, you need to assign the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] license to user accounts. To do this:

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home) and make sure that the slider for **The new admin center** option in the top right of the page is set to **on**.
