A Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides author can embed a link to a guide into a QR code to make it easier for operators to open a file on HoloLens. The link can open a guide or 
go to a specific step within a guide.

An operator using Dynamics 365 Guides can access the QR code in two different ways:

- **Printed QR code**. Operators can use a printed QR code to open a guide and anchor their holographic content at the same time. This makes it easy for operators to 
launch a guide quickly by gazing at a contextual printed QR code attached to the area where they need to do their work, and then anchor their holographic content 
to the same QR code.

- **Digital QR code**. Operators can use a digital QR code to open a guide without anchoring the guide. In this case, authors must provide another 
anchoring method for operators to align their holograms. Using a digital QR code is useful if you want to assign a guide to digital work instructions, 
or if you need a quick way for the operator to launch a guide when they don't have access to a printed QR code.

## Embed a QR code link in a guide

Embedding a QR code link in a guide involves two steps:

1. [Generate a guide link](pc-app-copy-link-guide-step.md). 

2. Use a third-party QR code generator to embed the link in the QR code. Microsoft recommends the following third-party QR code generators:

    - [https://goqr.me/](https://goqr.me/)    
    
    - [https://www.qr-code-generator.com/](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/)
    
    - [https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/](https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/)

 
> [!NOTE]
> When you use any third-party QR code generator, the QR code generator receives access to the string of your guides link.
