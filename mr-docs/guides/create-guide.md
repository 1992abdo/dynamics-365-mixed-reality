## Saving: how changes are synced between the PC app and HoloLens app

The PC authoring app and the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] app are connected through the cloud, where your [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] files and content are stored. 
When you author a guide, all changes are saved on both the PC and [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)]. This makes it easy to switch between devices. 
Autosave checks for changes every 4 seconds. You must be online to use [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> When you switch from one device to the other, it's best to close the guide to make sure you don't lose any work.
