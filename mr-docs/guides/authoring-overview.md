If you're ready to start creating a guide with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides, you're in the right place! 

To create a guide, you’ll use two applications:

- **PC application.** You’ll start with the PC application. Use this application to create the guide, choose an alignment method, 
add tasks and steps, write the instructions for your steps, and assign different types of assets to support those steps. 
Supporting assets include:

  - 3D parts
  - 3D objects, such as objects from the 3D toolkit (arrows and numbers, for example)
  - 2D media (images and videos)
  
- **HoloLens application in Authoring mode.** After creating the guide with the PC application, use the HoloLens application in Authoring 
mode to test the flow of your guide, assign holographic tethers to show operators where to focus, place your holograms in the real 
world, and add styles to 3D objects (warning or caution, for example).
