# Use voice commands in Dynamics 365 Guides

You can use voice commands in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides as a substitute for hand gestures or gaze. Most voice commands are contextual; they only work in certain areas of the user 
interface. 

## Prerequisites

•	Speech must be enabled in the device.

•	You must give permission to Dynamics 365 Guides to use your microphone during the first run of the app or by going to **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Microphone** > 
**Dynamics 365 Guides**.

> [!NOTE]
> Voice commands in Dynamics 365 Guides are only supported in [some languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/faq#what-languages-is-dynamics-365-guides-available-in). 
The language is based on the Windows display language, not the keyboard language. You can verify the Windows display language by selecting **Settings** > **Time and Language** > 
**Language**.
