# Use voice commands on HoloLens 2 in Dynamics 365 Guides

In [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)], you can use voice commands instead of hand gestures or gaze as a form of input. Most voice commands are contextual. In other words, they work only in certain areas of the user interface (UI).

> [!NOTE]
> Voice commands aren't supported on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] 1. On [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] 2, they are supported in the following languages: English, Spanish, German, Dutch, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese. The voice commands that you use are consistent with the display language of the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] operating system (OS). To view your display language, go to **Settings** \> **Time and Language** \> **Language**. 

## Provide permission for Dynamics 365 Guides to use the microphone

When you first install [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)], the app asks for permission to use the microphone.

Voice commands won't work unless you provide this permission. If you don't provide this permission when you first install the app, you can provide it later by going to **Settings** \> **Privacy** \> **Microphone**.
