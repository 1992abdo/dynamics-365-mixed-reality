# Follow a branching step in a guide in Dynamics 365 Guides 

Some guides created in Dynamics 365 Guides are linear in nature. You always go to the next step to complete the guide. In other cases, an author might create a 
branching (non-linear) guide if the scenario requires a different set of steps based on a particular response. For example, you may need to follow a different set of
steps based on a particular temperature reading.
