If you're an admin or an author for Dynamics 365 Guides, you can use the Guides model-driven app to do things that you can't do in the PC app or HoloLens app. For example, you can:

- Create workflows in Microsoft Power Apps to automate Dynamics 365 Guides processes

- Create folders to organize your guides

- Change a thumbnail for a video associated with a step

## Access the model-driven app

1. In the PC authoring app, sign in to the Dynamics 365 instance that includes the guide.

2. Select the **Analyze** tab, and then under **Instance URL**, select **Copy**, and then paste the value into the address bar of a web browser.

3. Sign in, and then in the left pane of the Power Apps screen, select **Guides** to open the model-driven app.
