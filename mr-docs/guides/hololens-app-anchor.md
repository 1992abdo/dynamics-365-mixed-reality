# Anchor a guide in the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app (for authors)

When you open a guide in the [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] HoloLens app, the first thing that you see is the anchoring instructions that were created in the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] PC app. The method that you use to anchor the guide depends on the type of anchor that was created in the PC app. For more information about how to create an anchor, and the types of anchors, see [Anchor your guide to the real world in Dynamics 365 Guides PC app](anchor.md).

## Anchor a guide by using a QR code anchor

1. Put on your HoloLens, and stand about two feet in front of the QR code anchor.

2. On the **Scan QR Code Anchor** page, select **Initiate Scan**.

3. With your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], look at the QR code anchor until a green outline appears. Use your gaze to align the green box with the anchor, and then select **Confirm**.

4. On the **QR Code Anchor Found** page, select **Confirm**.

## Anchor a guide by using a circular code anchor

1. Put on your HoloLens, and stand about two feet in front of the circular code anchor.

2. On the **Scan Circular Code Anchor** page, select **Initiate Scan**.

    On your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], you will see a holographic image that looks like the following illustration.

3. With your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], look at the circular code anchor until a green outline appears. Use your gaze to align the green box with the anchor, and then select **Confirm**.

4. On the **Circular Code Anchor Found** page, select **Confirm**.

## Anchor a guide by using a holographic anchor

- Use air tap and hold to move the holographic anchor and align it to its real-world counterpart. To rotate the anchor, tap and hold the blue spheres.

> [!TIP]
> On [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] 2, you can use your hand to directly select and place a digital anchor when you author a guide.

## Re-anchor a guide

When you anchor your guide, the anchoring information is stored on your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)]. Therefore, you don't have to re-anchor the guide every time that you open it. However, you can use the **Anchor** button to re-anchor a guide at any time, if you feel that the holograms are out of alignment.

> [!NOTE]
> To help guarantee accurate placement of 3D content, you might have to adjust the hardware offset on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] 1 devices. For more information, see [How do I address hardware offset in HoloLens 1 devices to ensure accurate placement of holograms for printed anchor alignment](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/known-issues#how-do-i-address-hardware-offset-in-hololens-1-devices-to-ensure-accurate-placement-of-holograms-for-circular-code-anchor-alignment).
