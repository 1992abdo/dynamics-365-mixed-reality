# Get started with Dynamics 365 Guides in preview

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]
 
So you’ve set up Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides in preview using the [Setup topic](setup.md) and you’re ready to get started. What do you do next?

There are three basic things you can do with Guides: 

- Create a guide (author a guide)

- Use a guide (operate a guide)

- Analyze the guide usage (see how people operating the guide did at each step). 

See our [Authoring](authoring-overview.md), [Operating](operator-guide.md), and  [Analyzing](analytics-guide.md) topics for step-by-step guidance on the above. Not sure about a  term? See our [Glossary of terms](glossary.md). 

## Jumping in

The best way to learn Guides is by doing, so here are some tips on getting started: 

1.	Use the Example Guide:

    - We have included an Example Guide that you can use to learn about Guides. It walks you through common workflows and features, provides tips and tricks for great guide creation, and helps you get up to speed by doing!

    - Put on your HoloLens, start the HoloLens app in Operator mode, and then select the Example Guide. Go through the guide step-by-step to learn about key features. 

    - Edit the guide steps and assets using the PC authoring app or place instructions or holograms using the HoloLens app in Author mode.
    
    


2.	Create your first guide from scratch, try it out, and analyze it!

     - Picking a scenario that works well for Guides is the first step. To create your first guide, find a simple step-by-step operation in a physical space that you have access to. We’ve created guides for operating a projector, pouring water into a glass, and making penguin olives! Or use a real-world workflow in your business. 

     - Build your first guide using standard 3D assets. Create your tasks and steps in the PC app, and then move to the HoloLens to place the instructions and holograms in the physical space they relate to. Refer to the [Authoring](authoring-overview.md) and [Operating](operator-guide.md) topics for help. 

     - After you’ve created your guide, try using it in Operate mode to see how it works. 

     - Analyze your usage of the guide with Power BI reports. See [Analyze your guides](analytics-guide.md) for more information.
