# HoloLens 1 gestures for operating (navigating) a guide in Dynamics 365 Guides

To navigate through a guide as an operator in Dynamics 365 Guides, you use your gaze and a few gestures. 

## Gaze 

Gaze on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] is pretty much as easy as it sounds. In some cases, you can select an item (an app, menu, or button, for example) just by gazing at a selection box next to the item. For example, when you first start the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] app, you’ll gaze at the box to the left of **Operate** in the following dialog box to select **Operate** mode.

The selection is completed when the box is filled up by your gaze. Using gaze is extremely helpful if your hands are occupied with tools or parts.  

In other cases in [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)], you use gaze to target an object, and then act on the target with a gesture, such as an air tap. In either case, when you gaze, make sure to turn your whole head—not just your eyes.  

## Gestures 
You’ll also need to use some gestures as you work with a guide. This section lists the most important gestures to know about. 

### Bloom 

The bloom gesture opens the **Start** menu or the **Quick Actions** menu, depending on which version of HoloLens you're using. Most of the time, you need to use the bloom gesture only once to get to **Start**, but sometimes you'll need to use it twice. If you're not sure what to do at any time, the bloom gesture is a good way to get reoriented.

To do the bloom gesture:

1.	Hold out your hand with your palm up and your fingertips together.

2.	Open your hand.

### Air tap 

Use air tap, along with gaze, to select apps and other holograms and any gaze/dwell buttons. To do an air tap: 

1.	Gaze at a hologram. 

2.	Hold your hand straight out in front of you in a loose fist, then point your index finger straight up toward the ceiling. You don’t need to raise your whole arm—keep your elbow low and comfortable. 

3.	Tap your finger down, and then quickly raise it back up again.

### The gesture frame

[!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] has sensors that can see a few feet to either side of you. When you use gestures, you'll need to keep them inside that frame, or [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] won't see them. As you move around, the frame moves with you. When your hand is inside the frame, the cursor looks like a ring. When [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] can't see your hand, the cursor changes to a dot. 

## Need a tutorial on gestures? 
For a tutorial on some basic gestures, use the bloom gesture to go to **Start**, and then select **Learn Gestures**. If you're having trouble with gestures, see [HoloLens and holograms: FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/help/13456/hololens-and-holograms-faq).
