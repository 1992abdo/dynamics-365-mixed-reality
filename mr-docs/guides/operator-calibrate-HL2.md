# Calibrate your HoloLens 2 device to use with Dynamics 365 Guides

[!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] uses holograms to show you, as an operator, exactly what you need to do to accomplish a real-world task. For example, your guide might show you how to assemble a door for a commercial aircraft. Since instructions are provided through holograms on Microsoft [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], it’s extremely important to make sure that the holograms are aligned properly. Otherwise you might drill a hole in the wrong place or even assemble the wrong part! To make sure holograms are properly aligned, you need to calibrate your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] device. You can do this by using the Calibration app that comes with your HoloLens. 

>[!NOTE]
>When using the device for the first time, you should automatically see this system prompt: **Let’s adjust [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] for your eyes**. To automatically begin calibration, select **Adjust**.

## Manually calibrate your HoloLens by using the Calibration app 

1. Use the start gesture to open the **Start** menu. For help with gestures, see [Gestures for navigating Dynamics 365 Guides](operator-gestures.md).

2. Select **+** to view all apps, if **Settings** isn't pinned to **Start**. 

    >[!NOTE]
    >To select something on the holographic **Start** menu, just touch the item with your index finger.

3. Select **Settings**. 

4. Select **System**. 

5. On the side panel, select **Calibration**. 

6. Select **Run Eye Calibration**. 

7. Follow the instructions on your screen.
