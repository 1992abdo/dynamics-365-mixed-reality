# Transition from public preview to GA

Thank you for being part of the Dynamics 365 Guides Preview! Since the release of Dynamics 365 Guides to the public at the end February 
at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, we have taken your feedback and invested in continually improving the experience and expanding 
functionality.  
 
Starting October 1, 2019, Dynamics 365 Guides is generally available.  
 
If you want to continue using Dynamics 365 Guides and receiving updates, you need to update the PC authoring app and the HoloLens app, 
and install new Dynamics 365 Guides solution using the Dynamics 365 Admin Center.  
 
Please follow the instructions below to transition to GA.  
 
## Step 1: Update the apps  

Update the Dynamics 365 Guides PC and HoloLens apps to the latest versions available in the Microsoft Store. 
 
## Step 2: Get the latest Dynamics 365 Guides solution 

1. Go to the [Dynamics 365 Admin Center](https://port.crm.dynamics.com/G/Instances/InstancePicker.aspx), and then sign in with the 
administrator credentials you used for public preview.  

2. Select the **Instances** tab, and then choose an instance that has the Dynamics 365 Guides Preview solution installed. 

3. Select the small edit button next to Solutions to see the list of solutions.

## When do I have to start paying for Dynamics 365 Guides?
