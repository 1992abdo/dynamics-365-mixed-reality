## What's new in Dynamics 365 Guides (July 9, 2019)

In the May release, we created a new flow for selecting an anchoring method. If you don't see these changes in the PC app, [your admin needs to do some updates]<a href="http://example.com/" target="_blank">Hello, world!</a>

The June release brings a new look and feel to the PC and HoloLens apps. We improved the user experience and aligned it with the Dynamics 365 family of apps. 
 
### Improved experience
The PC app is now fully responsive across various screen sizes. 

The navigation menu on the left and bottom right makes it much faster to navigate between guide content and guide anchor settings. 
 
“Gaze-dwell” interactions on HoloLens on the left side of each button make it easier to select buttons across the app. 

With the indented task panel, you can easily jump between tasks and steps. 
 
### What's New panel
The What's New panel (what you’re reading right now!) tells you about new and noteworthy features in each monthly release and alerts you about any required updates.
