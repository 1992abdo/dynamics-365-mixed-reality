# Entity reference for Dynamics 365 Guides (for developers)

When a guide is created by using the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides PC app, content and information in that guide are stored by using the 
Dynamics 365 Guides [entities](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/entity-overview) from [Common Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro) that are listed in the table later in this topic.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All entities that are installed as part of the Dynamics 365 Guides solution support the standard extensibility/programming model in Dynamics 365. You can access entity information by using either the [Web application programming interface (API)](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/webapi/overview) or the [Common Data Service Organization Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/org-service/overview).
>
> Dynamics 365 Guide entities and fields can be used with the Web API, and in [Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/) or a flow using [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/). However, we anticipate that these entities will evolve quickly in the near future. If you have an urgent need to do a business-critical integration, contact the Dynamics 365 Guides team directly for guidance, through your Microsoft Account team.
>
> Additionally, be careful when you programmatically create, update, or delete records for Dynamics 365 Guides entities. Some entities depend on other entities to provide user experiences and functionalities in the PC and HoloLens apps. Programmatic manipulation of these entities might prevent you from using the functionalities in the intended and supported way.
