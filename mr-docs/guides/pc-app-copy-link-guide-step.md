# Create and copy a link to a guide or step in Dynamics 365 Guides

You might want to create and copy a link to a guide or a step in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides if you want to:

- Share the link with another author through email or chat.

- Embed the link in a QR code. When you embed a link in a QR code, when you or the operator scans the QR code from the HoloLens shell, it automatically opens that guide or step.

## Create and copy a link to a guide

1. On to the **Home** page, right-click the appropriate guide.

2. Select **Copy link to this guide**.
