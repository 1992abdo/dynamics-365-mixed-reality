# Have HoloLens narrate Dynamics 365 Guides instructions

You can turn on narration to have Microsoft HoloLens read steps out loud when you're operating a guide in Dynamics 365 Guides. You can use narration when you're anchoring a 
guide or whenever you're working with an instruction, question, or completion step. This is useful if you donâ€™t want your workflow to be interrupted by having to constantly look
up at the instruction card.  

You can turn on narration through Settings or by using a voice command.

Narration uses the built-in HoloLens Text-to-Speech system. Narration is read in the default language set for the HoloLens device.

## Turn narration on or off in Settings

If you turn narration on or off in Settings, narration will stay on or off for the current and subsequent steps.

- In the **Settings** dialog box, move the **Narration** slider to the on position.
