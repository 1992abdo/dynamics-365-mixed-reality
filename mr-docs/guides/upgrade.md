# Upgrade the Dynamics 365 Guides solution (for admins)

This topic is for [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] administrators. Some releases of [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] require an update to the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] solution. When an update is required, the user will see a notification in the **What's new** panel.

Keep the following in mind:

- Before you update the solution in the Power Platform admin center, make sure that the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] PC and [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] apps have been updated to the latest version from the [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] Store.

- Updates to the solution must be done when the PC and [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] apps are not in use.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're currently using the public preview version of [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)], to get the October 2019 release, you'll need to search for the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] solution, and then select **Install** instead of **Upgrade**. This installs the general availability (GA) version of the solution and removes the public preview solution. For more information, see [Transition from public preview to GA](public-preview-transition.md).

To upgrade the solution:

1. Go to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/environments) and sign in with the user credentials that have admin permissions for [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)]. 

2. To select the environment, select the check mark, select the three dots button, and then select **Manage Solutions**.

3. Select **[!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)]** in the list of solutions, and then select **Upgrade**.

4. Review the Terms of service, and then select **Accept** if you're ready to start the upgrade. 

   The status of the solution changes to **Installation pending,** and then changes to **Installed** when the upgrade is complete.
