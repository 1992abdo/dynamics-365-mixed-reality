# Upgrade the Dynamics 365 Guides solution (for admins)

This topic is for [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] administrators. Some releases of [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] require an update to the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] solution. When an update is required, the user will see a notification in the **What's new** panel.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep the following in mind:<br><br>- Before updating the solution in the [!include[pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] Administration Center, make sure that the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] PC and [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] apps have been updated to the latest version from the [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] Store.<br><br>- Updates to the solution must be done when the PC and [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] apps are not in use.  

To upgrade the solution:

1. Go to the Dynamics 365 Administration Center and sign in with the user credentials that have admin permissions for [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)]. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > To go to the Dynamics 365 Administration Center, go to the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home), and then select **Admin centers** > **Dynamics 365** as shown below.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you're currently using the public preview version of [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)], to get the October 2019 release, you'll need to search for the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] solution, and then select **Install** instead of **Upgrade**. This will install the GA version of the solution and remove the public preview solution.
   
5. Review the Terms of service, and then select **Accept** if you're ready to start the upgrade. 

   The status of the solution changes to **Installation pending,** and then changes to **Installed** when the upgrade is complete.
