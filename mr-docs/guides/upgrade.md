# Upgrade the Dynamics 365 Guides solution

The May release of Dynamics 365 Guides includes updates for creating anchors (previously known as markers). To take advantage 
of the new anchoring features, you must update the Dynamics 365 Guides solution.

To upgrade the solution:

1. Go to the [Dynamics 365 Administration Center](https://port.crm.dynamics.com/G/Instances/InstancePicker.aspx), and then sign in with 
your administrator credentials (the credentials you created when you signed up for the Dynamics 365 Guides preview, if 
you created a new environment). 

2. Select an **Instances** tab, and then choose an instance that has the Dynamics 365 Guides solution installed.

3. Select the small edit button next to **Solutions** to see the list of solutions.
