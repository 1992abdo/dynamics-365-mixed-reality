# Overview of authing a guide with the Dynamics 365 Guides PC app

You use the PC authoring app in [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] as the first step in the authoring process.

Use the PC app to:

- Create a guide

- Choose an anchoring method

- Add tasks and steps

- Write the instructions for your steps

- Assign different types of content to support those steps. Supporting content includes:

  - 3D parts
  
  - 3D objects, such as objects from the 3D toolkit (arrows and numbers, for example)
  
  - 2D media (images and videos)
