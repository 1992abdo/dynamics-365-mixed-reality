# Integrate Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management (Asset Management module) with Dynamics 365 Guides

You can integrate the **Asset Management** module in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management with Dynamics 365 Guides to take advantage of mixed-reality guides in your day-to-day service and maintenance workflows. If a guide is associated with an Asset Management work order, when a worker opens the work order's Maintenance Checklist in the Finance and Operations (Dynamics 365) mobile app (1), the line details show that a guide is available (2). The worker can then find and open the guide in the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app (3).
