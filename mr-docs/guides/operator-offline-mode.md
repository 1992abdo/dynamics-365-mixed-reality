# Work offline as an operator in Dynamics 365 Guides

You can work offline with a guide (for example, if you're on a field service call or factory floor) if you don't have access to the internet or have an intermittent internet connection. You don't need to do anything to set up **Offline** mode. When you open a guide when you're connected to the internet, the guide is automatically downloaded for offline use. If you lose your internet connection or turn off your Wi-Fi connection, the guide will automatically be available and you'll see the **Offline** banner at the top of your screen.
