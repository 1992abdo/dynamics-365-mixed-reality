# Opt out of sending telemetry data to Microsoft in the Dynamics 365 Guides PC app

For privacy reasons, you can turn off the ability to send telemetry data to Microsoft. Microsoft uses this data to improve the product. Opting out prevents Microsoft from collecting any activity data.

To turn telemetry data off for the PC application:

1.  On the **File** menu, select **About**.

2. In the **About** dialog box, turn the **Send usage data** slider to off.

> [!NOTE]
> This option applies only to the device on which it's set. If you use [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] on more than one device, you need to modify the setting on those other devices. To turn this setting off for HoloLens, see [Author in the HoloLens application](hololens-authoring.md). Database administrators can also prevent usage data from showing in Power BI dashboards for Guides Analytics. For more information, see [Opting out of storing Dynamics 365 Guides events data in Common Data Service](data-opt-out.md).
