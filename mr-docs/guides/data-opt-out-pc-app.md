# Opt out of sending telemetry data to Microsoft in the Dynamics 365 Guides PC app

For privacy reasons, you can turn off the ability to send telemetry data to Microsoft. Microsoft uses this data to improve the product. Opting out prevents Microsoft from collecting any activity data.

To turn telemetry data off for the PC application:

1.  On the **File** menu, select **About**.

2. In the **About** dialog box, turn the **Send usage data** slider to off.

> [!NOTE]
> This option applies only to the device on which it's set. If you use [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] on more than one device, you need to modify the setting on those other devices. To turn this setting off for HoloLens, see [Author in the HoloLens application](hololens-authoring.md). Database administrators can also prevent usage data from showing in Power BI dashboards for Guides Analytics. For more information, see [Opting out of storing Dynamics 365 Guides events data in Common Data Service](data-opt-out.md).

## What's next?
After you create your guide on the PC, select an anchoring method, and create your tasks and steps, you’re ready to [test things out on HoloLens in a real-world environment, and place your holograms](hololens-authoring.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When switching between PC and [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], be sure to select **Refresh** when starting work on a device to ensure that you have the latest version of the guide. 

Don’t worry if your guide isn’t perfect before switching to [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] authoring. You can always go back to the PC application to edit and restructure your guide. In fact, we’ve found it’s generally a good idea to do a quick test of the flow on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], and then go back to the PC application to make changes before placing all your holograms in [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)].

> [!TIP]
> If you’re creating multiple versions of the same guide, you might want to use the **Save a Copy** command on the **File** menu. This is great for guides that are similar but have a few different steps. You don’t have to start from scratch!
