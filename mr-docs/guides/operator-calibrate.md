## First things first – calibrate your HoloLens 
[!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] uses holograms to show you exactly what you need to do to accomplish a real-world task. For example, your guide might show you how to assemble a door for a commercial aircraft. Since instructions are provided through holograms on [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], it’s extremely important to make sure that the holograms are aligned properly. Otherwise you might drill a hole in the wrong place or even assemble the wrong part! To make sure holograms are properly aligned, you need to calibrate your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] device. You can do this by using the Calibration app that comes with your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)].
