# Create a trigger for step navigation in Dynamics 365 Guides

If you’re using HoloLens 2 with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides, you can create a trigger that automatically advances an operator to the next step based on detection of their 
hand(s). This provides a very natural way for operators to complete a task. You place the triggers in the real world where the work takes place. The operator doesn’t have to 
disrupt the flow of their work by gazing at a button on the instruction card after completing each step. 

When an operator activates a trigger, they see a Next Step or Previous Step visual cue wherever they’re gazing to let them know that they’ve completed the step. They also 
receive audio feedback for extra reinforcement.

> [!NOTE]
> You can create a trigger with a HoloLens 1 device, but you can’t test a trigger on HoloLens 1, and operators on HoloLens 1 won’t be able to use the trigger since 
triggers require HoloLens 2 hand detection.
