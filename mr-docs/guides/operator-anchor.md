# Anchor a guide in the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app (operators)

The first thing you see when you open a guide is the anchoring instructions for the guide.

> [!NOTE]
> The screen above shows the anchoring instructions for a printed anchor. This screen would look different if you need to anchor your guide with a digital anchor. The anchoring instructions will tell you how to go about anchoring your guide.

Anchoring a guide is a crucial step, just like calibrating [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)]. You anchor a guide to make sure that the holographic instructions line up with your real-world environment. If the holograms don’t line up, you’ll likely be confused when you try to do a task. You could even cause damage. For example, you might drill a hole in the wrong place. 

## Printed anchors vs digital anchors

There are two types of anchors: a printed anchor and a digital anchor. The way you anchor your guide depends on which method is used.

### Anchor your guide using a printed anchor

1. Look for a printed anchor attached to a physical object in your real-world environment. The printed anchor looks like this:

2. On your HoloLens [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], you’ll see a hologram that looks very similar to the printed anchor. Find the printed anchor in your real-world environment, and then align the anchor hologram with the printed anchor.    
   
3. When the green box is aligned to the printed anchor, gaze at **Confirm** to select it.

4. When you see the **Printed anchor found** screen, follow the instructions on the screen, and then select **Confirm** to continue.

### Anchor your guide using a digital anchor

With a digital anchor, you align a hologram on your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] with a similar object in the real world.

To align the digital anchor with its real-world counterpart, air tap and hold to move the hologram, and tap and hold the blue spheres to rotate the hologram, if needed.

## Where alignment information is stored 

When you align your guide, if you’re using the [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] Commercial Suite, the alignment information is stored on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] so you don’t have to realign the guide every time you open it. You can realign a guide at any time, though, if you feel the holograms are out of alignment. For more information, read about the **Anchor** button in the next section.
