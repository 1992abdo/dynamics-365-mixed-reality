## Glossary

### Air tap
Air tap is a type of gesture that’s equivalent to a “click” with a mouse. For more information on how to do an air tap, see Gestures to know.

### Alignment
You align a guide in HoloLens to make sure the content “lines up” with associated objects in the real world. Alignment is crucial and mandatory for creating any guide. For more information, see Align your guide.

### Asset
Asset is the collective term used to refer to the complete set of objects that you can add to a step to support that step. Assets include 2D objects (images and videos) and 3D objects (3D parts and objects from the 3D toolkit). 

### Author
The author is the person who creates a guide.

### Calibration
The HoloLens device must be calibrated correctly so that the guide aligns properly in the real world. Proper calibration is also necessary to place holographic objects in HoloLens Authoring mode. HoloLens includes a Calibration app that can be used by authors and operators for this purpose. Learn more about calibrating HoloLens.

### 3D toolkit
Guides comes with a set of 3D objects that you can use to get started right away. For example, there are 3D objects such as pointers and arrows that you add to a step to support that step.

### Digital twin
A digital twin is a 3D representation used for one type of alignment. You place the digital twin, which can be a CAD model or scanned model, directly over its counterpart in the real world, and then use a gesture to align the guide to the digital twin.

### Field of view
Field of view refers to the size of the HoloLens display where holograms show up. It’s important to keep the field of view in mind when placing holograms in a real-world environment.

### Fit box setting
Use the Fix box setting to make sure the HoloLens device fits properly. A proper fit is very important for alignment purposes.

### Gaze
Gaze refers to looking at a target with the HoloLens. After targeting an object with gaze, you typically act on it with a gesture.

### Gesture
Hand gestures enable operators to do actions in mixed reality. For more information, see Gestures to know.

### IPD
Interpupillary distance (IPD) is the distance between a user’s eyes. Different users have different IPDs. To align content correctly, the HoloLens needs to be calibrated for each user’s IPD. Learn more about calibrating HoloLens.

### Marker
A marker is a computer-generated visual used for one type of alignment. You gaze at the marker to align the guide with its spatial coordinates.

### Operator
The operator is the person that uses a guide to do a set of tasks. 

### Outline page
Use the outline page in the PC Authoring application to add tasks and steps. From the Outline page, you can get a sense of the whole guide and restructure tasks by dragging them from one place to another. The Outline page also includes customizable alignment instructions and a special step called the Completion step (also customizable).

### Step
A step is a short, discrete work item that an operator does to complete a task. Tasks are made up of steps. Steps are also the central navigation point in a guide.

### Step card
The Step card is the fundamental building block in Guides. You add text and supporting assets to a Step card in the PC Authoring application, and then place holograms associated with each step in a real-world environment in HoloLens Authoring mode. The operator works through each step to complete a task or series of tasks. Learn more about Step cards.

### Style
You can add a style to any 3D object to reinforce what you want the operator to do or know. Examples of styles include Pick up, Place, and Caution.

### Task
A task is a piece of work to be done or undertaken. A task is made up of steps that the operator must follow to complete the task. 

### Tether
A tether is a holographic link that ties a step visually to the area where you want the operator to focus. It helps the operator find content or understand what they’re supposed to be looking at in the real world. You can use a tether together with a 3D object, such as a holographic arrow or number. 

### 3D parts
3D parts are 3D content that you assign to a step to support that step. You assign 3D parts in the PC application, and then place the holograms in a real-world environment in HoloLens Authoring mode.
