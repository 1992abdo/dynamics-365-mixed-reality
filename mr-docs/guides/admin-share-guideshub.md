<!-- This article is a copy of the article below with the term "Model Driven App" updated to "Guides Hub".   A better solution will have to be found to "customize" core power apps support documents to address the specific D365 Guides user experience.

# Share Guides Hub


Guides Hub is and app built on PowerApps Technology.  Power Apps use role-based security for sharing. The fundamental concept in role-based security is that a security role contains privileges that define a set of actions that can be performed within the app. All app users must be assigned to one or more predefined or custom roles. Or, roles can also be assigned to teams. When a user or team is assigned to one of these roles, the person or team members are granted the set of privileges associated with that role.
