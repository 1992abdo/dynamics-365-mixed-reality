# HoloLens 2 gestures for navigating a guide in Dynamics 365 Guides

To navigate through a guide as an operator in Dynamics 365 Guides, you use your gaze and a few gestures.

## Gaze

Gaze on HoloLens is pretty much as easy as it sounds. In some cases, you can select an item (an app, menu, or button, for example) 
just by gazing at a selection box next to the item. For example, you can select the **Next** or **Go back** button on an instruction card by gazing at the button. The selection is completed when the box is filled up by your gaze.

Using gaze is very helpful if your hands are occupied with tools or parts. In other cases in Dynamics 365 Guides, you use gaze to 
target an object, and then act on the target with a gesture, such as an air tap. In either case, when you gaze, make sure to turn 
your whole head—not just your eyes.

## Gestures

You’ll also need to use some gestures as you work with a guide. This section lists the most important gestures to know about.

### Open the Start menu

You can open the **Start** menu on HoloLens 2 with one hand or two hands. If you're not sure what to do at any time, opening the **Start** menu is a good way to get reoriented.

### To open the Start menu with one hand

1.	Hold out one of your hands, palm facing up, and look at your wrist. You’ll see a holographic Windows logo.

2.	On the hand you’re holding out, touch your index finger to your thumb in a pinching motion.

### To open the Start menu with two hands

1.	Hold out one of your hands, palm facing up, and look at your wrist. You’ll see a holographic Windows logo.

2.	With your other hand, touch the Windows logo with your index finger.

### Air tap

Use air tap, along with gaze, to select apps and other holograms and any gaze/dwell buttons. To do an air tap:

1.	Gaze at a hologram.

2.	Hold your hand straight out in front of you in a loose fist, then point your index finger straight up toward the ceiling. You don’t need to raise your whole arm—keep your elbow low and comfortable.

3.	Tap your finger down, and then quickly raise it back up again.

### The gesture frame

HoloLens has sensors that can see a few feet to either side of you. When you use gestures, you'll need to keep them inside that frame, or HoloLens won't see them. As you move around, the frame moves with you. When your hand is inside the frame, the cursor looks like a ring. When HoloLens can't see your hand, the cursor changes to a dot.
