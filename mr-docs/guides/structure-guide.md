# Structure your guide in the Outline page in the Dynamics 365 Guides PC app

After you [create a guide](create-guide.md) with the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] PC app or open an existing guide, you see the **Outline** page. In the **Outline** page, you create a framework for your guide by adding as many tasks and steps as you need. Tasks are groups of steps. Steps are the short, discrete work items that operators do to complete the task. Steps are the central building blocks in [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)].

>[!NOTE]
>You can also use the **Outline** page to choose an anchoring method for the guide or to change the existing anchoring method. For information on anchoring a guide, see [Anchor your guide to the real world](anchor.md).

The **Outline** page provides a great way to map out your guide at the start, or to get an overall picture of the guide after you’ve added all your tasks and steps. You can also restructure your guide from the **Outline** page by dragging tasks and steps.

The **Outline** page includes a special step called a **Completion** step that's included in all guides. This step lets operators know when they’ve reached the end of the guide. The **Completion** step includes default text that you can customize as you see fit.

Here’s an example of a filled-out **Outline** page:

## Go to other pages from the Outline page

Use the buttons in the navigation bar on the left side of the **Outline** page to get to other pages in the PC app. The following table describes the navigation bar buttons.

|Button|Name|Action|
|--------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
|![Open Navigation button](media/open-navigation-button.png "Open Navigation button")|**Open Navigation**|Expand the navigation bar to include descriptors for each button.|
|![Home button](media/home-button-pc-app.png "Home button")|**Home**|Go to the **Welcome** page. In the **Welcome** page, you can create a new guide or open an existing guide.|
|![Analyze button](media/analyze-button-pc-app.png "Analyze button")|**Analyze**|Go to the **Analyze** page. In the **Analyze** page, you can set up Power BI reports (Guides Analytics) to analyze your guides.|
|![Anchor button](media/anchor-button-pc-app.png "Anchor button")|**Anchor**|Go to the **Choose an anchor method** wizard. In the wizard, you can choose from different anchor methods for your guide or change the type of anchoring method.|
|![Step button](media/step-button-pc-app.png "Step button")|**Step**|Go to the **Step Editor** page. In the **Step Editor** page, you can add your instruction text and add supporting 2D or 3D content.|

## Work with tasks and steps

When you open the **Outline** page for a newly created guide, you'll see that a single task and step are already created for you.

## Best practices for the Outline page

- To provide overall context, add an Overview task at the start of the guide. This task would include just one step that describes what the guide is about. This is also a good place to list all the tasks that the guide covers. 

- Add a step at the beginning and end of each task to let the operator know when they’re starting something new or ending a task, and to make the operator feel successful when they complete a task.

- Don’t be afraid to add lots of steps, but remember to keep them short for best effect. 

- Consider adding steps that show individual tips and tricks.
