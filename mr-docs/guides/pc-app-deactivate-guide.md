# Deactivate a guide

If a guide is out of date or you want to keep operators from accessing it, you can deactivate it. 

1. On the **Home** screen, right-click the guide you want to deactivate.

    ![Deactivate command](media/author-deactivate-guide.PNG "Deactivate command")

2. Select **Deactivate**.

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >When a guide is deactivated, it may still appear on the list of recent guides but you (and your operators) won't be able to open it. To reactivate a guide, or to delete it permanently, contact your administrator (or any user with admin access to the Guides Hub). [If you're an administrator, learn how to deactivate a guide](admin-deactivate-guide.md).
