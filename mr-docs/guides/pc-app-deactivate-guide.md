# Deactivate a guide if you're a Dynamics 365 Guides author

If you're an author for Microsoft [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)], you can deactivate a guide if it's out of date or you want to prevent operators from accessing it.

1. On the **Home** page, right-click the guide that you want to deactivate.

2. Select **Deactivate**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > After a guide is deactivated, it will continue to appear in the **Recent** list, because this list always shows the 12 most recently opened guides. However, neither you nor your operators will be able to open the guide.
    >
    > To reactivate a guide, or to delete it permanently, contact your admin or another user who has admin access to the Guides Hub. For information about how to deactivate a guide if you're an admin, see [Deactivate a guide (admins)](admin-deactivate-guide.md).
