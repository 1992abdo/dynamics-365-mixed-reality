# Compatibility between Dynamics 365 Guides solution and apps (PC and HoloLens)

It's recommended that you always update the Dynamics 365 Guides solution with every release so that you have access to the latest features and updates. However, if you suspect you have an older solution version and need to check for compatibility with the PC and HoloLens apps you're using, see the table below.

You can check the app version in the PC app by using the **About** command.
