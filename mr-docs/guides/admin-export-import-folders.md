# Export and import Dynamics 365 Guides folders between environments

You can export folders you have created in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides and import them into another environment to recreate your folder structure. You do this by:

1. Creating a new solution in your environment

2. Adding folders as components of the new solution

3. Downloading a zip file that you can import into another environment.

The content associated with these folders (guides, 3D content, and media) will not be included in this process. However, you can use the [Content Migration tool](migrate.md) to migrate this content after youâ€™ve imported your folders.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you export and import your folders first, and then transfer the content, the relationships between the folders and the content will be reconstructed.

For more info on solutions, see the following links:

- [Introduction to solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/introduction-solutions)

- [Solution concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/alm/solution-concepts-alm)

## Prerequisites 

- You must be a system administrator to access the Power Platform admin center.  

- You must have Dynamics 365 Guides solution version 600.1.0.0 or later.  

We also highly recommend [backing up the contents](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/backup-restore-environments#create-a-manual-backup) of both environments before starting the export/import process. 

## Export the folders

1. Go to [make.powerapps.com](https://make.preview.powerapps.com/), and then sign into the environment that contains the folders you want to export. Make sure to check in the upper-right corner that the environment of your choice is selected.

2. In the left navigation pane, select **Solutions**.

3. An the top of the Power Apps page, select **Switch to classic**.

4. Create a new solution by doing the following:  

    1. At the top of the screen, select **New**.  

       ![All Solutions view with New command highlighted](media/export-import-4.PNG "All Solutions view with New command highlighted")

    2. Enter a display name. This will be the name of your solution.  

    3. In the **Publisher** field, select **Default Publisher for {orgid}** from the drop-down menu.  

    4. In the **Version** field, enter **1** or **1.0.0.0**.

    4. Select **Save**.  

       ![Fields and Save command highlighted](media/export-import-5.PNG "Fields and Save command highlighted")

4. To add the folders as components of your solution:  

    1. Select **Add Existing** > **Folder**.  

       ![Add Existing > Folder highlighted](media/export-import-6.PNG "Add Existing > Folder highlighted")

    2. Select the folders you want to include in your export, and then select **OK**.

       > [!NOTE]
       > If you select a folder that includes subfolders, you'll need to select the parent folder and the child folder individually. However, if you select a subfolder, the parent folder will automatically be added to the list that will be exported. 

5. To export your solution:  

    1. Select **Save**.

    2. Select **Export Solution**.  

       ![Save button and Export Solution command highlighted](media/export-import-8.PNG "Save button and Export Solution command highlighted")
       
    3. Select **Next**.

    4. Select **Next**.

       ![Export System Settings dialog with Next button highlighted](media/export-import-10.PNG "Export System Settings dialog with Next button highlighted")
       
    5. Select between a managed and an unmanaged solution, and then select **Export**.

       ![Package Type dialog with Export button highlighted](media/export-import-11.PNG "Package Type dialog with Export button highlighted")
       
       > [!NOTE]
       > Select a managed solution if you want the rows to be permanently tied to the solution. This means that if you delete the solution, the rows that were imported as part of the managed solution will be deleted as well (including any guides saved under the folders, since deletion of a folder is cascading). This will also prevent you from re-exporting the rows. On the other hand, if an unmanaged solution is deleted from the environment, the rows will persist. 

7. Once the export is ready, it should automatically download as a .zip file. This might take a while.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Deactivated folders will appear in the list to be exported. They can be imported into a new environment and will remain deactivated.
      
## Import the folders

1. Go to [make.powerapps.com](https://make.preview.powerapps.com/) and **ensure you are in the environment where you want to import the folders**. You can check this in the top right corner of the screen under **Environments**.      

2. In the left navigation pane, select **Solutions**, and then select **Switch to classic**.

    ![Power Apps screen with Solutions command and Switch to classic command highlighted](media/export-import-13.PNG "Power Apps screen with Solutions command and Switch to classic command highlighted")

3. At the top of the screen, select **Import**, and then select **Choose File**.

    After your solution has been imported, you'll see it in the **All Solutions** list.
