# Export and import Dynamics 365 Guides folders between environments

You can export the folders you have created in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides and import them into another environment to recreate your file structure. The guides, 3D 
content and media associated with these folders will not be included in this process. However, you can use the Migration Tool script to migrate this content after 
youâ€™ve imported your folders.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you export and import your folders first, and then transfer the content, the relationships betwen the folders and the content will be reconstructed.

## Prerequisites 

- You must be a system administrator to access the Power Platform admin center.  

- You must have Dynamics 365 Guides solution version 600.1.0.0 or later.  

We also highly recommend [backing up the contents](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/backup-restore-environments#create-a-manual-backup) of both environments before starting the migration process.
