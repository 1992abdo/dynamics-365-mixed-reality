# Activate, deactivate, or delete a guide in Dynamics 365 Guides (admins)

If [a guide has been deactivated](pc-app-deactivate-guide.md), you can reactivate it if you're an administrator. When you reactivate a guide, it will be immediately available for authors to open or edit in the PC app. 

You can also deactivate a guide or permanently delete it if you're sure you no longer need the guide.

1. Sign in to the instance with your admin credentials.

    >[!TIP] 
    >To find the url for the instance, in the PC app, select the **Analyze** tab, copy the URL in the **Instance URL** field at the bottom of the screen, and then paste the url into your web browser.<br>![Instance URL](media/instance-url.PNG "Instance URL")

2. In the Power Apps screen, select the **Guides** app tile.

3. In the **Active Guides** list, select **Inactive Guides** to view all currently inactive guides.

4. Select the check box next to the appropriate guide, and then select **Activate**, **Deactivate** or **Delete** at the top of the screen.

    >[!WARNING]
    >You can't recover a guide if you delete it permanently.
