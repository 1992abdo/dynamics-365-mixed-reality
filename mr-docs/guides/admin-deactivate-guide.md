# Activate, deactivate, or delete a guide in Dynamics 365 Guides (admins)

If [a guide has been deactivated](pc-app-deactivate-guide.md), you can reactivate it if you're an administrator. When you reactivate a guide, it will be immediately available for authors to open in the PC app. You can deactivate a guide or permanently delete it if you're sure you no longer need the guide.

1. Sign in to the instance with your admin credentials.

    >To find the url for the instance, in the PC app, select the **Analyze** tab, and then copy and paste the url into your web browser.<br>![Instance URL](media/instance-url.PNG "Instance URL")
