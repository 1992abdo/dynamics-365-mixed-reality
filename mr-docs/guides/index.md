[!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] is a mixed-reality application for [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] that lets operators learn during the flow of work by providing holographic instructions when and where they are needed. These instruction cards are visually tethered to the place where the work must be done, and can include images, videos, and 3D holographic models. Operators see what must be done, and where. Therefore, they can get the job done faster, with fewer errors and greater skill retention.

## No coding skills are required to create mixed-reality guides

With [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)], you don't need specialized 3D or programming skills. Start with the PC authoring app to create a *guide*: step-by-step instructions together with images, video, and 3D holograms. After you create the guide on a PC, use the HoloLens app to connect the instruction cards and holograms to the physical workspace by picking them up and moving them to the correct location. You can use the default library of 3D holograms to get started. You can also import your own custom 3D models.

## Improve productivity â€“ Learn by doing

[!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] provides heads-up, hands-free, step-by-step instructions during the flow of work, whether employees are doing complex procedures on the job or training away from the production line. Operators control the interface with their gaze, using a glance to move to the next step. Therefore, their hands are left free to do the work. Instruction cards move together with the operator, following them as they move around equipment, pointing to the tools and parts that they need, and showing them exactly how and where to use them. The experience is comfortable and simple to use, and it helps reduce mental processing time, errors, and the need to rely on a buddy system.

## Continually analyze and improve processes

Managers can use [!include[pn-power-bi](../includes/pn-power-bi.md)] dashboards to view rich data about how processes are working for their employees. In this way, they can continually analyze and improve process without having to do expensive studies.

[!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] also provides access and integration opportunities for customers and partners, because it's part of the [!include[pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] product family and is powered by Common Data Service.
