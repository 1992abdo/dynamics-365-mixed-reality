# Overview of Dynamics 365 Guides

[!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] is a mixed-reality application for [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] that enables operators to learn in the flow of work by providing holographic instructions when and where they need them. These instruction cards are visually tethered to the place where the work needs to be done and can include images, videos, and 3D holographic models. Operators see what needs to be done where, so they can get the job done faster, with fewer errors, and with greater skills retention.

## No specialized skills required to create mixed-reality guides

With [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)], you don't need specialized 3D or programming skills. Start with the PC authoring app to create a guide — step-by-step instructions with images, video, and 3D holograms. After creating the guide on a PC, use the HoloLens app to connect the instruction cards and holograms to the physical work space by picking them up and moving them to the right location. Use the default library of 3D holograms to get started. You can also import your own custom 3D models.   

## Improve productivity — learn while doing

[!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] provides heads-up, hands-free, step-by-step instructions in the flow of work, whether employees are doing complex procedures on the job or training away from the production line. Operators control the interface with their gaze (using a glance to move to the next step) leaving their hands free to do the work. Instruction cards move with the operator, following them as they move around equipment, pointing to the tools and parts they need and showing them exactly how and where to apply them. The experience is comfortable, simple to use, and reduces mental processing time, errors, and the need to rely on a buddy system. 

## Continually analyze and improve your processes   

Using [!include[pn-power-bi](../includes/pn-power-bi.md)] dashboards, managers can view rich data about how processes are working for their employees, enabling them to continually 
analyze and improve without doing expensive studies. 

[!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] also provides access and integration opportunities for customers and partners since it's part of the [!include[pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] product family and is powered by Common Data Service.
