# Overview of Dynamics 365 Guides

[!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] is a mixed-reality application for [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] that enables operators to learn in the flow of work by providing holographic instructions when and where they need them. Operators follow step-by-step instruction cards that are visually tethered to the place where the work needs to be done. The instruction cards can include images, videos, and 3D holographic models that show operators what needs to be done where, so they can get the job done faster, with fewer errors, and with greater skill retention.

## Create mixed-reality guides without the need for specialized skills

With [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)], anyone can create step-by-step mixed-reality guidance for a task, without the need for specialized 3D or programming skills. Start with the PC authoring app to create guides — step-by-step instructions with images, video, and 3D holograms. After creating the guide on a PC, authors 
use HoloLens to connect the instruction cards and holograms to the physical work space by picking them up and 
moving them to the right location. Authors can use the default library of 3D holograms to get started. They can also import their own custom 3D models.   

## Improve productivity by enabling your workforce to learn while doing their work

Whether it’s doing complex procedures on the job or while training away from the production line, [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] provides heads-up, hands-free, 
step-by-step instruction in the flow of work. Employees can control the interface with their gaze (using a glance to move to the next 
step) leaving their hands free to do the work. Instruction cards move with the worker, following them as they move around equipment, 
pointing to the tools and parts they need and showing them exactly how and where to apply them. The experience is comfortable, 
simple to use, and reduces mental processing time, errors, and the need to rely on a buddy system. 

## Continually analyze and improve your processes   

Using [!include[pn-power-bi](../includes/pn-power-bi.md)] dashboards, managers can see rich data about how the process is working for their people, enabling them to continually 
analyze and improve without doing expensive studies. Being part of the [!include[pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] product family and powered by Common Data Service, [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] allows customers and partners access and integration opportunities.
