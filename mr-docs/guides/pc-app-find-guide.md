# Find a guide in the Dynamics 365 Guides PC app

1. [Open the PC app](install-sign-in-pc-app.md).

2. Open the **Home** page, enter a name in the filter box, and then select the **Filter** button.

    > [!TIP]    
    > You can also look for a guide by:
    > - Navigating the folder structure through the **All** tab or the folder breadcrumbs above the filter box. Note that folders never appear on the **Recent** tab. [Learn how to create folders with the Guides model-driven app](admin-create-folders.md).
    > - Selecting the **All** or **Recent** tabs, and then sorting the resulting list by selecting the **Name** and **Date Modified** column headers (**All** tab), or the **Name** and **Date Accessed** column headers (**Recent** tab).
