## Before you start

Before you get started with Guides authoring, you’ll want to understand your project and get organized. Here’s a quick checklist 
to start you out on the right foot:

- Gather as much content as you can before you begin creating your guide. This includes images, videos, and 3D content 
(if you have any), and the physical objects themselves (if feasible). Don’t worry if you don’t have any 3D content. 
Guides includes a 3D toolkit that you can use to get started.
- Make sure you understand the space, the assembly, and the workflow you’re authoring for. arrange for access to the space 
so you understand the real-world environment. You’ll also need access to the space to align the guide and place holograms later.
- Arrange for access to the space so you understand the real-world environment. You’ll also need access to the space to align 
the guide and place holograms later.
- A great way to start is to create a video of the assembly you want to show, or have someone (an expert in that process, 
for example) create one for you. You can refer to the video as you create your guide. If you’re using a video as a starting 
point, make sure it’s representative of the guide you want to create though. For example, are you creating a guide for an 
expert or a novice?

## Using media and 3D content to your advantage

As you consider the media and 3D content you want to use for your project, keep in mind that size matters greatly on HoloLens 
both for the quality of the experience and performance. It’s best to use high-fidelity assets where details matter and low-fidelity 
assets for high-level principles where details aren’t as important.

### Best practices for pictures (images)
- Images are best for quick reference, validation, or special techniques
- Pictures are a great and inexpensive way to orient an operator, so use lots of them.
- When taking pictures, make sure to take a picture of the whole object for overall context, as well as close-up pictures for precision.
- When taking pictures, also keep in mind the perspective of the operator. It’s helpful to take the picture from the same angle 
that the operator will use. 
- Pictures are very efficient for identifying specific patterns, shapes, or colors.
- For performance reasons, don’t use 4K/HD quality pictures. **Total image size shouldn’t exceed 100 KB.**

### Best practices for videos
- Videos are best for first-time users
- Keep videos short and focused on a single step.
- Overview videos don’t work well generally, because operators may think they’re supposed to do the assembly while they’re watching 
the overview video. 
- When filming video, make sure to show a wide angle for context and then a close-up of the actual work and hand motions.
- Effective videos “teach” how to do something. If you just take a video of someone on the floor doing a process they’re very 
familiar with, it’s likely that:
  - They’ll move too quickly.
  - They won’t talk through the tasks step-by-step.
  - They won’t teach the task the way management wants them to teach it.
- Videos are very effective for showing specific hand movements.
- Audio is very useful for step-by-step instructions. Watching someone do a task without audio doesn't provide as much context. Consider
using video captions, if available, for noisy environments.

### Best practices for 3D content
3D content is best for adding in-context clarity. Guides includes a 3D toolkit that includes 3D models that you can use to add 
clarity to your instructions. For example, the 3D toolkit includes arrows, hands, zones, and icons. These assets are already 
optimized for HoloLens. For more information, see Add 3D objects to support your steps.

You can also create and import your own custom 3D parts. If you use custom 3D parts, make sure to optimize it as much as possible 
before importing it to Guides. It’s also good to break up 3D parts as much as possible. For example, if you have a 3D model that 
shows a composite part for an engine, create separate 3D parts for all the individual pieces to better highlight the parts in a step.

## Setting up a folder structure
To organize content, you may want to create a folder structure with separate folders for text, 3D assets, images, and videos to make 
it easy to find and use the different types of assets.

### Naming your files 
When naming your content pieces, consider using standard prefixes so that all your assets are organized together in the library. 
For example:
- eng_01.png
- eng_video01.wmv
