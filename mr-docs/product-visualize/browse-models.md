# View 3D models stored on your device in Dynamics 365 Product Visualize

You don't have to have a Dynamics 365 account to view 3D models in Dynamics 365 Product Visualize. If you have a 3D model (GLB file) stored on your device, you can browse to it in Dynamics 365 Product Visualize to see what the model would look like.

1. Go to the **My Open Opportunities** page.

   SCREEN SHOT WILL GO HERE. 
   
2. Select **View Models**.

   SCREEN SHOT WILL GO HERE

3. Select **Continue**.
   
   Dynamics 365 Product Visualize browses your device and displays any GLB files.
