# View 3D models stored on your device in Dynamics 365 Product Visualize

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You don't have to have a Dynamics 365 account to view 3D models in Dynamics 365 Product Visualize. If you have a 3D model stored on your device in GLB file format, you can browse to it in Dynamics 365 Product Visualize to see what the model would look like.

1. Tap **Main** ![Main menu](media/hamburger-icon.png "Main menu"), and then tap **Import model**.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
   > ![Import model](media/import-model.png "Import model")

2. Tap **Continue**.

   Dynamics 365 Product Visualize browses through your device and displays any GLB files.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to see dimensions for the model, enable the **Product dimensions** feature. To enable this feature, see [Enable product dimensions](product-dimensions.md). After enabling the feature, tap **Dimensions** at the bottom of the screen to see the dimensions for the 3D model.<br><br>Preview features are experimental features that provide access to new innovations that the Dynamics 365 Product Visualize team is working on.
