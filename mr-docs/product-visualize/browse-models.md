# View 3D models stored on your device in Dynamics 365 Product Visualize

You don't have to have a Dynamics 365 account to view 3D models in Dynamics 365 Product Visualize. If you have a 3D model stored on your device in GLB file format, you can browse to it in Dynamics 365 Product Visualize to see what the model would look like.

1. Go to the **My Open Opportunities** page, and then tap **View Models**.

   ![My Open Opportunities screen](media/open-opportunities.PNG "My Open Opportunities screen")
   
2. Tap **Continue**.
   
   Dynamics 365 Product Visualize browses through your device and displays any GLB files.
   
    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to see dimensions for the model, enable the **Product dimensions** feature. To enable this feature, see [Enable product dimensions](product-dimensions.md). After enabling the feature, tap **Dimensions** on the right side of the screen to see the dimensions for the 3D model.<br><br>Preview features are experimental features that provide access to new innovations that the Dynamics 365 Product Visualize team is working on.
