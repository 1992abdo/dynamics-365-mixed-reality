# Place and manipulate 3D models in Dynamics 365 Product Visualize

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The home page of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Product Visualize is the **My Open Opportunities** page. Each opportunity typically has multiple products within it, and each product can have multiple 3D models.

![Opportunities, products, and 3D models](media/manipulating-3D-models.PNG "Opportunities, products, and 3D models")

> [!NOTE]
> If you're the administrator, you can learn how to add 3D models to Dynamics 365 Sales through the [Administrator guide](admin-guide.md).

## View (place) a 3D model in mixed reality 

1.	Open the opportunity you want to focus on.

2.	Select a product within that opportunity.

3.	In a brightly lit environment, point your device down toward a flat surface like the floor or a desk. Move your device around slowly to allow Dynamics 365 Product Visualize to find the surface.

    After you find a suitable surface, you'll see the model-loading indicator.
      
4.  To place the model, select **Place** on the right side of the screen.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to see dimensions for the model, enable the **Product measurements feature**. To enable this feature, see [Enable product measurements](product-measurements.md). After enabling the feature, select **Dimensions** on the right side of the screen to see the dimensions for the 3D model.<br><br>Preview features are experimental features that provide access to new innovations that the Dynamics 365 Product Visualize team is working on.  

## Move, rotate, or change the size of your model

Chances are, you'll want to move, rotate, or change the size of your model in some way after you place it. You can use various gestures to do any of these actions after placing your model.

### Change the size of your model

Spread or pinch two fingers on the screen to change the size of the model.
