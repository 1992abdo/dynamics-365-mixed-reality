# Place and manipulate 3D models

The home screen of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Product Visualize is the **My Open Opportunities** page. Each opportunity typically has multiple products within it, and each product can have multiple 3D models. 

![Opportunities, products, and 3D models)](media/manipulating-3D-models.PNG "Opportunities, products, and 3D models")

## View a 3D model in augmented reality 

1.	Open the opportunity you want to focus on.

2.	Select a product within that opportunity.

3.	Select the 3D model you want to view.

4.	In a brightly lit environment, point your device down toward a flat surface like the floor or a desk. Move your device around slowly to allow Product Visualize to find the surface.

    After you find a suitable surface, you’ll see the model loading indicator:

    After the model has loaded, it will appear in the default size. You can view the model in this size or at life-size scale. 

5.	If you want to change the size of the model to life-size before you place it, select the **Life-size** button (right button at the bottom of the screen).

6.  To place the model, select **Place** on the right side of the screen.

## Switch to a different model

After placing a model, if you want to view a different model, you can switch models very easily.

1.	Select **Models** on the right side of the screen.

2.	In the **Models** screen, select the model you want to view.

3.	Switch between the default size or life-size if desired (note that you can’t change the scale until the model is loaded), and then place the model as described in the previous procedure.  

## Move, rotate, or change the size of your model

Chances are, you’ll want to move, rotate, or change the size of your model in some way after you place it. You use the **Transform** button to do any of these actions after placing your model.
