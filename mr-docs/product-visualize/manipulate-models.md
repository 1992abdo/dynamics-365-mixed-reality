# Place and manipulate 3D models in Dynamics 365 Product Visualize

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The home page of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Product Visualize is the **My Open Opportunities** page. Each opportunity typically has multiple products within it, and each product can have multiple 3D models.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're the administrator, to learn how to add 3D models to Dynamics 365 Sales, see the [Administrator guide](admin-guide.md).

## View a 3D model in mixed reality 

1.	Open the opportunity you want to focus on.

2.	Select a product within that opportunity.

    The first model in the product is displayed. 

3.	In a brightly lit environment, point your device down toward a flat surface like the floor or a desk. Move your device around slowly to allow Dynamics 365 Product Visualize to find the surface.

    After you find a suitable surface, you’ll see the model-loading indicator:
      
4.  To place the model, select **Place** on the right side of the screen.

## Switch to a different model

After placing a model, if you want to view a different model, you can switch models very easily:

1.	Select **Models** on the right side of the screen.

2.	Select the model you want to view.

3.	Place the model as described in the previous procedure.  

## Move, rotate, or change the size of your model

Chances are, you’ll want to move, rotate, or change the size of your model in some way after you place it. You can use various gestures to do any of these actions after placing your model.
