# Create a mixed reality session

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

A mixed reality session represents a chance to sell your products to a customer. Salespeople can view their mixed reality sessions directly from the Dynamics 365 Product Visualize app, but they must be added through the Product Visualize Hub interface. A mixed reality session contains products along with their models.

**To add a mixed reality session**

1.  [Sign in to Product Visualize Hub](sign-in-app.md).

2.  In the left navigation pane, select **Mixed Reality Sessions**.

3.  On the toolbar at the top of the page, select **New**.

4.  In the **Name** field, enter a name for the mixed reality session.

5.  Select **Save**.
