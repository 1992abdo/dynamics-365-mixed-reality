# Create a mixed-reality session

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

A mixed-reality session represents a chance to sell your products to customers by showing them 3D models of your products. Salespeople can view their mixed-reality sessions directly from the Dynamics 365 Product Visualize iOS app, but the sessions must be added through the Dynamics 365 Product Visualize Hub interface.

**To add a mixed-reality session**

1.  [Sign in to Dynamics 365 Product Visualize Hub](sign-in-app.md).

2.  In the left pane, select **Mixed Reality Sessions**.

    ![Select Mixed Reality Sessions from the left pane](media/mr-session.png "Select Mixed Reality Sessions from the left pane")

3.  On the toolbar at the top of the page, select **New**.

4.  In the **Name** field, enter a name for the mixed-reality session.

5.  Select **Save**.
