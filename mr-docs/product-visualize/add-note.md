# Add a note to your 3D model

You can capture notes on specific points on a 3D model and even add text or ink to the notes. For example, when you’re out in the field with a customer, capture any required product changes directly on the model. 

To add a note, you tap the location of the model where you want to add the note, and then  take a picture of the model or upload a picture from your photo library to set the context.  Then you can ink on the image or add comments.  Notes you create are saved in a notes file in the Documents folder for the corresponding Dynamics 365 for Sales opportunity. 

Product Visualize includes a notes browser that makes it easy to see all the notes attached to a model. The notes appear as a card  at the bottom of the screen. You can swipe to move forward and backward between notes in the browser, or you can tap a blue dot (spatial anchor) to select any note attached to the model. If the note is off the screen, you’ll see a blue dot with an arrow that points in the direction of the note.
