# Add a note to your 3D model in Dynamics 365 Product Visualize (in preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You can capture notes on specific points on a 3D model and even add text or ink to the notes in Microsft Dynamics 365 Product Visualize (in preview). For example, when you’re out in the field with a customer, capture any required product changes directly on the model. 

To add a note, you tap the location of the model where you want to add the note, and then  take a picture of the model or upload a picture from your photo library to set the context.  Then you can ink on the image or add comments.  Notes you create are saved in a notes file in the Documents folder for the corresponding Dynamics 365 for Sales opportunity. 

Product Visualize includes a notes browser that makes it easy to see all the notes attached to a model. The notes appear as a card  at the bottom of the screen. You can swipe to move forward and backward between notes in the browser, or you can tap a blue dot (spatial anchor) to select any note attached to the model. If the note is off the screen, you’ll see a blue dot with an arrow that points in the direction of the note.

       > [!NOTE]
       > If you’re not happy with the picture, select **Replace** to redo the capture or select a different picture from your camera roll. When you select **Replace**, any text you entered will be retained, but inking will be lost.

    > If you want to see a larger view of the notes, which is useful if you can’t see all the text in the notes card, tap the expand arrow in the upper-right corner of the notes card or flick up. Then you can use the scroll bar in the notes card to scroll the text.

1. Select the Main menu button ![Main menu](media/hamburger-icon.png "Main menu button"), and then select the **Edit** button next to the organization you're signed into.

2. Under **Sharing Notes**, move the sliders to the off position for the options you want to turn off.
