# Optimize and transcode 3D models

Presenting complicated products to a customer with traditional 2D materials isn't very effective, and creating physical 
3D models is time-consuming and costly. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Product Visualize simplifies the entire process by bringing 3D digital models into the real-world. Currently, Product Visualize supports GLB files. A GLB file is a bundled form of a glTF file.

For information on how to optimize and transcode your 3D files, see this external site topic: [Art Pipeline for glTF](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2083000).
