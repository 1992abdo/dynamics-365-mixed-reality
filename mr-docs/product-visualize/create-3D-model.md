# Optmize and transcode 3D models

Presenting complicated products to a customer with traditional 2D materials always left something to be desired and creating physical 
3D models was time-consuming and costly. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Product Visualize simplifies the entire process by bringing 3D digital models into the real-world. Currently, Product Visualize supports GLB files.
