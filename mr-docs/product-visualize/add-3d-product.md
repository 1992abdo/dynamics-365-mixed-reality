# Add a 3D product

Products are the things you sell to a customer, and they can be physical goods or services. Products that a customer might be interested in purchasing are added to a sales opportunity. This enables salespeople to exactly track a customer's needs to the potential revenue a sale might bring in.

1.  [Sign in to Product Visualize Hub](sign-in-app.md).

2.  In the left navigation pane, select **3D Product Catalog**.

3.  On the toolbar at the top of the page, select **New**.

4.  On the **New 3D Product** page, provide the following information:

    - **Name**: Name of the product.

    - **Product Id**: ID of the product.

5.  Select **Save**.
