# Product Visualize Hub user guide

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Once Product Visualize Hub is setup by your administrator, you are ready to create products, add models to the created products, create mixed reality sessions, and much more.

## Using Product Visualize Hub

**Prerequisites**: You must be signed in to the app. For information about how to sign in to Product Visualize Hub, see [Sign in to Product Visualize Hub](sign-in-app.md).

After signing in, you must add products and create mixed-reality sessions. The mixed-reality sessions can be used by a salesperson using the [Product Visualize iOS app](user-guide.md). These sessions are used to showcase large and highly customizable products to customers in their real-world environment. A mixed-reality session can contain multiple products, and each product can contain multiple 3D models.

For example, you work in a company named Fabrikam. that manufactures customized coffee machines. You have a demo scheduled with your client Contoso for the installation of coffee machines at their premises. You can't carry all models of coffee machines for the demo. You can create a mixed-reality session, add 3D models of coffee machines, and show them to your customer in their real-world environment using the iOS app.

Perform the following steps to successfully create a mixed-reality session:

1. **Add a 3D product**: Products are the things you sell to a customer, and they can be physical goods or services. Considering the earlier example, you can add a product named Coffee Machine. More information: [Add a 3D product](add-3d-product.md)

2. **Add 3D model to a product**: You can add multiple 3D models to your product. 3D models help your customer to view your products as how they will look in real life. Considering the earlier example, you can add all models of coffee machine to your product and show them to your customer. More information: [Add 3D models to a product](add-3d-model-product.md)

3. **Create a mixed reality session**: A mixed reality session represents a chance to sell your products to a customer. Considering the earlier example, you can create a mixed-reality session named Contoso. More information: [Create a mixed reality session](create-mr-session.md)

4. **Add a product to a mixed reality session**: After creating the mixed-reality session, add your product to it. Considering the earlier example, you must add the Coffee Machine product to the Contoso mixed-reality session. More information: [Add a product to a mixed reality session](add-product-mr-session.md)

You can also [add notes to your 3D model](add-note-model.md) in Product Visualize Hub. These notes will be visible in the Product Visualize iOS app.

You can also [set up Microsoft Teams](setup-ms-teams.md) to collaborate with your team, manage files, and have conversations in one easy-to-use location.
