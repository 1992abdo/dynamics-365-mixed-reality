# Add 3D models to a product

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Presenting complicated products to a customer by using traditional 2D materials is unsatisfactory, and creating physical 3D models is time-consuming and costly. Dynamics 365 Product Visualize simplifies the entire process of bringing 3D digital models into the real world.

**To add 3D models to a product**

1.  [Sign in to Dynamics 365 Product Visualize Hub](sign-in-app.md).

2.  In the left pane, select **3D Product Catalog**.

    ![Select 3D Product Catalog from the left pane](media/product-catalog-nav.png "Select 3D Product Catalog from the left pane")

3.  On the **Active 3D Products** page, select the product to which you want to add a model.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If no products are displayed, it means you've not added any product. See [Add a 3D product](add-3d-product.md) to add a product.

4.  Under **3D Viewer**, select **Add 3D Model**.

5.  Find and select the 3D model.

6. Repeat steps 4 through 5 to add more 3D models.

## Manipulate a model

1.  [Sign in to Dynamics 365 Product Visualize Hub](sign-in-app.md).

2.  In the left pane, select **3D Product Catalog**.

3.  On the **Active 3D Products** page, select your product.

4.  Under **3D Viewer**, select the model to you want to manipulate.

    - To zoom in on the model, hover over it and scroll up by using the mouse wheel.

    - To zoom out from the model, hover over it and scroll down by using the mouse wheel.

    - To manipulate your view of the model, click in the model and drag to change your view.<!--Edit okay? Writing Style Guide says "don't use click and drag."-->

## Create a thumbnail of a model

Thumbnails are small-size versions of photos or videos used to help you recognize and organize them.<!--I'm not sure you need to define a thumbnail for this audience; maybe delete the preceding sentence?--> When you add a 3D model to a product, no thumbnail is displayed for the model. It appears as shown in the following image.

![Model without thumbnail](media/model-no-thumbnail.png "Model without thumbnail")

When you add a thumbnail, an image of the model is displayed.

![Model with thumbnail](media/model-thumbnail.png "Model with thumbnail")

**To create a thumbnail for a model**

3.  On the **Active 3D Products** page, select your product.

4.  Under **3D Viewer**, select the model for which you want to create a thumbnail.

5.  Select **Create Thumbnail**.

6.  Select **Back** to view the thumbnail of the model.

## Delete a model

1.  [Sign in to Dynamics 365 Product Visualize Hub](sign-in-app.md).
