# Add your own 3D model to an existing Dynamics 365 Sales product

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

If you have a 3D model stored in SharePoint or OneDrive, or on your local device, it's simple to add it to a product included in a Dynamics 365 Sales opportunity from Dynamics 365 Product Visualize<!--I'm deleting "(in preview)" because I don't know what it's referring to. If the phrase refers to adding a model to an existing product, shouldn't there be a "preview feature"-type disclaimer as there is for "Enable product dimensions"? -->.

> [!NOTE]
> 3D models must be in GLB format to link them to a product.

**To add a 3D model to a product**
<!--note from editor: If this heading is the only H2 (and it merely echoes the title of the article), you don't need it to be an H2. There's a similar situation in explore-samples.md. Procedure headings don't actually need to be in the article TOC at all unless they occur under different H2s; that's why by default they're simply formatted in bold without any heading style.-->
1.	Tap **Main** ![Main menu](media/hamburger-icon.png "Main menu"), and then tap **Import model**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Import model](media/import-model.png "Import model")
 
2. In the confirmation message, tap **Continue**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Confirmation message](media/confirm-import-model.png "Confirmation message")

3.	Select a model from the list of recently used models or tap **Browse** to search for models on your device.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Select a model to be imported](media/recent-models.png "Select a model to be imported")

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Browse a model to be imported](media/browse-models.png "Browse a model to be imported")
 
4.	Point your device down toward a flat surface like the floor or a desk, and then tap **Place** to place the model.
