# Add your own 3D model to an existing Dynamics 365 Sales product

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

If you have a 3D model stored in Microsoft SharePoint or OneDrive, or on your local device, it's simple to add it to a product included in a Dynamics 365 Sales opportunity from Microsoft Dynamics 365 Product Visualize (in preview).

> [!NOTE]
> 3D models must be in GLB format to link them to a product.

## Add a 3D model to a product

1.	Tap **Main** ![Main menu icon](media/hamburger-icon.png "Main menu icon"), and then tap **Import model**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Import model](media/import-model.png "Import model")
 
2. In the confirmation message, tap **Continue**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Confirmation message](media/confirm-import-model.png "Confirmation message")

3.	Select a model from the list of recently used models or tap **Browse** to search for models on your device.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Select a model to be imported](media/recent-models.png "Select a model to be imported")

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Browse a model to be imported](media/browse-models.png "Browse a model to be imported")
 
4.	Point your device down towards a flat surface like the floor or a desk, and then tap **Place** to place the model.
