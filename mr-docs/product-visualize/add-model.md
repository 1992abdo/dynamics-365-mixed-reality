# Add your own 3D model to an existing product

If you have a 3D model stored in SharePoint or OneDrive, or on your local device, it’s simple to add it to a product included in a Dynamics 365 for Sales opportunity. 

> [!NOTE]
> 3D models must be in GLB format to link them to a product. 

## Add a 3D model to a product

1.	In the **My Opportunities** screen, open the appropriate opportunity. 
 
2.	Select the product you want to add the model to. 

3.	In the **Models** screen, select the plus (+) sign in the upper-right corner of the screen.
 
4.	In the **Browse Your Files** screen, select the service where the 3D model is stored, or select **Your Files** to access the files on your device.
 
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you select SharePoint, you’ll see a list of SharePoint sites associated with your Dynamics 365 sign-in credentials. 

5.	When prompted to link the model, select **Confirm**. 
 
    When the model is ready, you’ll see a **Success!** message and then you’ll be back on the screen where you selected the model so you can add additional models if you want.
