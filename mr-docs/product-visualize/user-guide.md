Microsoft Dynamics 365 Product Visualize empowers sellers to showcase and customize products in their   actual environment, 
helping create a shared understanding between buyer and seller to accelerate complex sales processes.

## Install and sign in to Product Visualize

Product Visualize works together with Dynamics 365 for Sales, so you’ll need a Dynamics 365 account to access the full power of the app.    When you sign in with your Dynamics 365  for Sales account, the Product Visualize app automatically connects to your Dynamics 365 for Sales opportunities.

> [!TIP]
> If you just want to explore sample 3D content or upload your own 3D content to try it out, you don’t need to have a Dynamics 365 account. For more information, see [Explore sample content later in this topic]().NOTE TO SELF: ADD ANCHOR

Your Dynamics 365 sign-in credentials are typically provided by your administrator. They’ll be in the form: <username>@<domainname>.

## Work with 3D models

The home screen of Product Visualize is the **My Opportunities** page. Each opportunity typically has multiple products within it, and each product can have multiple 3D models. 

### View a 3D model in augmented reality 

1.	Open the opportunity you want to focus on.

2.	Select a product within that opportunity.

3.	Select the 3D model you want to view.

4.	In a brightly lit environment, point your device down toward a flat surface like the floor or a desk. Move your device around slowly to allow Product Visualize to find the surface. 

    After you find a suitable surface, you’ll see the model loading indicator:
 
    After the model has loaded, it will appear in the default size. You can view the model in this size or at Life-size scale. 

5.	If you want to change the size of the model to life-size before you place it, select the **Life-size** button (left button at the bottom of the screen). 
  
To place the model, select **Place** on the right side of the screen.

### Switch to a different model

After placing a model, if you want to view a different model, you can switch models very easily.

1.	Select **Models** on the right side of the screen.
 
2.	In the **Models** screen, select the model you want to view.
 
3.	Switch between the default size or life-size if desired (note that you can’t change the scale until the model is loaded), and then place the model as described in the previous procedure.  

### Move, rotate, or change the size of your model

Chances are, you’ll want to move, rotate, or change the size of your model in some way after you place it. You use the **Transform** button to do any of these actions after placing your model.

#### Change the size of your model

When you change the size of your model, you can switch between meter-cube size and Life-size-scale  size. 

1.	Select the **Transform** button on the right side of the screen.

2.	Select the **Resize** button. 

3.	Spread or pinch your fingers to change the size of the model.

    > [!TIP]
    > Select **Undo** if you ever need to undo your changes when you’re transforming the model.

#### Rotate your model  

1.	Select the **Transform** button on the right side of the screen.

2.	Select the **Rotate** button.

2.	Select the **Lift** button.
  
3.	Drag your finger up or down on the screen. 

### Add a note to a model

You can capture notes on specific points on a 3D model and even add text or ink to the notes. For example, when you’re out in the field with a customer, capture any required product changes directly on the model. 

To add a note, you tap the location of the model where you want to add the note, and then  take a picture of the model or upload a picture from your photo library to set the context.  Then you can ink on the image or add comments.  Notes you create are saved in a notes file in the Documents folder for the corresponding Dynamics 365 for Sales opportunity. 

Product Visualize includes a notes browser that makes it easy to see all the notes attached to a model. The notes appear as a card  at the bottom of the screen. You can swipe to move forward and backward between notes in the browser, or you can tap a blue dot (spatial anchor  ) to select any note attached to the model. If the note is off the screen, you’ll see a blue dot with an arrow that points in the direction of the note.  

#### Add a note

1.	After placing a model, select Notes on the right side of the screen.
 
2.	Select **Add**.
 
3.	Tap the model where you want to place the note. 
 
4.	Do one of the following:

    -	To do a new capture, select **Capture** on the right side of the screen. The app will take a picture of the model.
    
    -	To use a picture from your camera roll, select **Camera Roll**, and then select the picture you want.
   
5.	In the **Create Note** screen:

    - To ink on the screen, select a color and start drawing. For example, draw an arrow  to call out a particular part of the model.
    
    - To add text, tap the box at the bottom of the screen, and then enter the text you want.
 
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you’re not happy with the picture, select **Replace** to redo the capture or select a different picture from your camera roll. When you select **Replace**, any text you entered will be retained, but inking will be lost. 
    
6.	If you want to change the settings for sharing notes, in the **Create Note** screen, select **Share Settings**. By default, notes are shared in the opportunity timeline in Dynamics 365 for Sales . You can also choose to share notes in a Microsoft Teams channel, or you can turn off sharing altogether if you want. When you’re done changing settings, select **Update all**.  
 
    > [!TIP]
    > You can also access global settings for sharing notes. To do this, select the main menu button  , select the **Edit** button next to the organization you’re signed in to, and then under **Sharing Notes**, select the option you want: **Dynamics 365 for Sales Opportunity Timeline** and/or **Connect Teams Channels**.
    

#### View the notes attached to a model

1.	After placing the model, select **Notes** on the right side of the screen.
 
2.	Select **Browse**.  
 
3.	Tap a blue dot to open a specific note or swipe right or left in the notes browser at the bottom of the screen to go forward or backward between notes.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to see a larger view of the notes, which is useful if you can’t see all the text in the notes box, tap the expand arrow   in the upper-right corner of the notes box or flick up. Then you can use the scroll bar in the notes box to scroll the text. 
  
#### Edit or delete a note

1.	Select **Notes** on the right side of the screen.
2.	Select **Browse** to open the notes browser.
3.	Select the **Overflow** menu   in the upper-right corner of the notes box.
4.	In the **Options** dialog box, select **Edit Note** or **Delete Note**.
  
#### Change the share status of a note

By default, Product Visualize sends your notes to your Dynamics 365 for Sales timeline and any connected Microsoft Teams channel. If you turn this option off, your notes will be stored only Product Visualize until you turn them back on again. 

To change the share status of a note:

1.	Select **Notes** on the right side of the screen.
2.	Select **Browse** to open the notes browser.
3.	Select the **More options** button   in the upper-right corner of the notes box.

## Add your own 3D model to an existing product

If you have a 3D model stored in SharePoint or OneDrive, or on your local device, it’s simple to add it to a product included in a Dynamics 365 for Sales opportunity. 

> [!NOTE]
> 3D models must be in GLB format to link them to a product. 

### Add a 3D model to a product

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you select SharePoint, you’ll see a list of SharePoint sites associated with your Dynamics 365 sign-in credentials. 

5.	When prompted to link the model, select **Confirm**. 
 
    When the model is ready, you’ll see a **Success!** message and then you’ll be back on the screen where you selected the model so you can add additional models if you want.

## Explore sample 3D models

Product Visualize comes with sample 3D models  that you can try out even if you don’t have a Dynamics 365 subscription. Use the sample content to try out the Product Visualize app and play with 3D models. When you explore a 3D model this way, you place it just like you would any other 3D model, and you can also add notes to the model. Notes you add to a sample model isn’t saved, however, when you close Product Visualize.
