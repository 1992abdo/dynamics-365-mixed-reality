Microsoft Dynamics 365 Product Visualize empowers sellers to showcase and customize products in their   actual environment, 
helping create a shared understanding between buyer and seller to accelerate complex sales processes.

## Install and sign in to Product Visualize

Product Visualize works together with Dynamics 365 for Sales, so you’ll need a Dynamics 365 account to access the full power of the app.    When you sign in with your Dynamics 365  for Sales account, the Product Visualize app automatically connects to your Dynamics 365 for Sales opportunities.
