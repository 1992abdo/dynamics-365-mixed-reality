# User guide for Dynamics 365 Product Visualize

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Product Visualize empowers sellers to showcase and customize products in their real-world environment. Using Augmented Reality, sellers can create a shared understanding between themselves and buyers to accelerate complex sales processes. Showing your customers products in 3D is more compelling than showing them flat images. Our app also gives you other capabilities that aren’t available with conventional sales tools. You can conduct an entire sales meeting with the Product Visualize app, using the following features:

**Place a model**

If you have 3D models of your products, you can show them to your client in a meeting using the Product Visualize app. Simply place the model in your space to analyze it from different perspectives and have a conversation with your client. The app uses your device's camera to read the surrounding environment, and places a 3D holographic model on a surface you select.

> [!TIP]
> - You can help the program select the best surface by scanning the surface on which you want to place your model. Scan a surface by pointing your device's camera down at a flat surface and panning it slowly right to left. 
> - If you are having trouble detecting a surface, or loading a model, make sure that the surface you are scanning is not too shiny. Lay a contrasting flat object (such as a sheet of paper) on the surface you want to select if you think it is too shiny. Re-scan the surface.

You can move the model around your space, rotate and resize it, or change the surface it is placed on. This enables you to display all sides and features of your product to clients without the need to carry heavy samples. You can also test the fit of a product in space using the Dimensions tool to display the real-life dimensions of the product on the 3D model. You can match these dimensions to the real-world space where the product would sit.

**Add a note to your model**

You can add notes on your model before the meeting to highlight sales points for the client. If they have a question or comment during the meeting, you can take a note to record that for a follow-up. This way, the comments are captured in context of specific points on the model, so you and your teammates can always be on the same page.

Notes capture images of your model in context, and allow you to attach text or annotate the image by drawing on it. Notes you create may be exported using Teams or email.

**View layers on your model**

For complex 3D models that are built with layers, you can turn these on and off for your client. This will help them get a better understanding about the inner parts of the product or even different available configurations. You can display details or individual components of a complex model using layers.

**View your models offline**

If you're going to be in a location with low internet connectivity, you can download your models and notes to be available offline. This way, you will never miss a beat with your clients, and your resources will always be at your fingertips. This feature gives you a way to always carry your catalog of products with you, without having to carry hundreds of pages of documents to every meeting, even when you can’t connect to the cloud.
