# Set up Dynamics 365 Product Visualize on a new Dynamics 365 instance

Dynamics 365 Product Visualize requires an active Dynamics 365 instance. This topic provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a new Dynamics 365 trial instance and installing the Dynamics 365 Product Visualize solution.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have an existing Dynamics 365 instance, you can skip to [Step 2: Install the Dynamics 365 Product Visualize solution](#step-2-install-the-dynamics-365-product-visualize-solution) and start working with the solution immediately.

## Step 1: Get a Dynamics 365 trial instance

1. Go to [https://trials.dynamics.com/](https://trials.dynamics.com/).
