[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

To get the full benefits of Dynamics 365 Product Visualize, you'll need a Dynamics 365 account. When you sign in with your Dynamics 365 Sales account, Dynamics 365 Product Visualize automatically connects to your Sales opportunities.

> [!TIP]
> If you just want to explore sample 3D content, you don't need a Dynamics 365 account. More information: [Explore sample 3D models](explore-samples.md)

Dynamics 365 Product Visualize pulls in your opportunities from Sales by default. You can also view followed opportunities and connect opportunities.

## Sign in from Sales

You can also open Dynamics 365 Product Visualize directly from Sales on your iOS device. This makes it easy to visualize your products in 3D as you work with your sales opportunities.

If you haven't already installed Dynamics 365 Product Visualize on your iOS device, you can install it from Sales.

### Sign in from Sales for the first time

1.	Open one of your opportunities in Sales.

2.	Select the **Product Visualize Launcher** tab.

<!--note from editor: These "See also" blocks didn't originally include "Enable product dimensions," so I added it to all the individual user guide topics. If it shouldn't be there because it's a preview feature, please excuse (and perhaps delete the link to "Download 3D models" too).-->
