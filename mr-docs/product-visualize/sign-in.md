# Install, open, and sign in to Dynamics 365 Product Visualize

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

To get the full benefits of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Product Visualize, you'll need a Dynamics 365 account. When you sign in with your Dynamics 365 Sales account, Dynamics 365 Product Visualize automatically connects to your Dynamics 365 Sales opportunities.

> [!TIP]
> If you just want to explore sample 3D content, you don't need a Dynamics 365 account. For more information, see [Explore sample 3D models](explore-samples.md).
 
## Install the app

1.	Go to the Apple App Store.

2.	Search for **Dynamics 365 Product Visualize**.

3.	Download and install the app.

## Two ways to open and sign in

You can open and sign in to Dynamics 365 Product Visualize on your iOS device in two different ways:

- Open the app on your iOS device like you would any other app, and then sign in.
- Select any 3D model (GLB file) in your Dynamics 365 Sales opportunity.

> [!NOTE]
> At this time, Dynamics 365 Product Visualize is available for iOS devices only.

## Open the app on your iOS device and sign in for the first time

1.	On your iOS device, search for **Dynamics 365 Product Visualize**, and then open the app.

2.	On the **Welcome** screen, tap **Sign in**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > After you sign in for the first time, this screen won't appear again.

    > [!TIP]
    > If your organization isn't set up with Dynamics 365 Sales, you can explore sample models or go to the [Dynamics 365 Sales website](https://trials.dynamics.com/Dynamics365/Signup/sales) to learn how to sign up.  

5.	On the **My Open Opportunities** screen, tap the opportunity you want to work on.

    Dynamics 365 Product Visualize pulls in your opportunities from Dynamics 365 Sales by default. You can also view followed opportunities and connect opportunities.
    
## Sign in from Dynamics 365 Sales

You can also open Dynamics 365 Product Visualize directly from Dynamics 365 Sales on your iOS device. This makes it easy to visualize your products in 3D as you work with your sales opportunities.

If you havenâ€™t already installed Dynamics 365 Product Visualize on your iOS device, you can install it from Dynamics 365 Sales.

### Sign in from Dynamics 365 Sales for the first time
