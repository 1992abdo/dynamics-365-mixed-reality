# Explore sample 3D models in Dynamics 365 Product Visualize

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Product Visualize comes with sample 3D models you can try out even if you donâ€™t have a Dynamics 365 subscription. Use the sample content to try the Dynamics 365 Product Visualize app and play with 3D models. When you explore a 3D model this way, you place it just like you would any other 3D model, and you can also add notes to the model. Notes you add to a sample model aren't saved, however, when you close Dynamics 365 Product Visualize.

## Open a sample 3D model

1.	Open the Dynamics 365 Product Visualize app.

2.	On the **Welcome** screen, scroll down to the sample 3D models, and select the 3D model that you want to open.

     You can also select the **Main** ![Main menu button](media/hamburger-icon.png "Main menu button") menu button, and then select **Sample products** to see samples.

3.	Place the model as described in [Place and manipulate 3D models](manipulate-models.md), and then size, rotate, move, or lift the model.

4.	Add notes as described in [Add a note to your 3D model](add-note.md). Notes made on sample models are not saved when you close Dynamics 365 Product Visualize or replace the model. 

    >[!TIP]
    >If you want to see dimensions for the model, you can enable the **Product measurements feature**. To enable this feature, select the Main menu ![Main menu](media/hamburger-icon.png "Main menu"), select **Preview features**, and then slide the **Product measurements feature** setting to On. Preview features provide access to new innovations that the Product Visualize team is working on. Preview features are considered "experimental."
