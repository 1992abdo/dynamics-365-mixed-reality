# Explore sample 3D models

Product Visualize comes with sample 3D models  that you can try out even if you don’t have a Dynamics 365 subscription. Use the sample content to try out the Product Visualize app and play with 3D models. When you explore a 3D model this way, you place it just like you would any other 3D model, and you can also add notes to the model. Notes you add to a sample model isn’t saved, however, when you close Product Visualize.

## Open a sample 3D model

1.	Open the Product Visualize app.

2.	In the **Welcome** screen, select **Explore Sample 3D Models**. 
  
3.	In the **Sample Models** screen, select the 3D model you want to open.
 
4.	Place the model as described earlier in this topic, and then size, rotate, move, or lift the model.

5.	Add notes as described earlier in this topic. Notes will not be saved when you close the Product Visualize app.
