# Show or hide layers in a 3D model in Dynamics 365 Product Visualize 

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

A single 3D model in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Product Visualize consists of one or more layers, which you can think of as categorized objects often grouped by function or location.

A single layer can also act as a folder that includes other layers.

You can create layers in a flattened or nested format by using CAD model design software tools. For more information on converting CAD models to use with Dynamics 365 Product Visualize, see [Convert your 3D (CAD) models with the Dynamics 365 Import Tool (Preview)(https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/import-tool/convert-models).

## Show or hide a layer
