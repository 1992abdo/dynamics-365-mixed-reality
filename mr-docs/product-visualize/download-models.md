# Download 3D models to use offline with Dynamics 365 Product Visualize

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You can download models to use offline when you're away from a cellular network or Wi-Fi. To download models for offline use, you need to first enable the offline mode feature. More information: [Enable offline mode feature](enable-preview-features.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Downloading models for offline use is a preview feature. Preview features are experimental features that provide access to the latest innovations that the Dynamics 365 Product Visualize team is working on.

## Download a 3D model

- When viewing a product, tap the **Cloud** button next to the product name to download the model.

   When the model is downloaded, a blue check mark is displayed in place of the cloud button.
