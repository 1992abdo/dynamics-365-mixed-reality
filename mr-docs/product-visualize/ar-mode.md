# View 3D models without using your device's camera

You can view 3D models in Product Visualize without using your device's camera and augmented reality. You can place the model on a gray background or use a background image. This feature allows you to show a toggle button that helps you turn AR mode on and off. When the AR mode is turned off, you can place a 3D model on a gray background or use a background image from your Photos library. When you turn on the AR mode, you can use your device's camera and augmented reality to place a 3D model. To view 3D models without using your device's camera, you must enable the AR mode feature.

> [!NOTE]
> Viewing 3D models without using your device's camera is a Preview feature. Preview features are experimental features that provide access to the latest innovations that the Dynamics 365 Product Visualize team is working on.

## Enable AR mode

1. Tap **Main** ![Main menu](media/hamburger-icon.png "Main menu"), and then tap **Preview features**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Preview features](media/preview-features.png "Preview features")

2. In the **Feature Settings** screen, move the **Show AR mode toggle button** toggle to the On position.

## Turn AR mode on and off

After you enable the AR mode feature, the AR mode is turned off by default and the 3D models are placed on a gray background. A toggle button is displayed at the top of the screen while placing a model. To turn on the AR mode, tap the toggle button.

> ![Model placed with AR mode off](media/ar-off.png "Model placed with AR mode off")

When you turn on the AR mode, you can use your device's camera and augmented reality to place a 3D model.
