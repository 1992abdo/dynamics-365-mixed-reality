# Overview of Dynamics 365 Product Visualize (in preview)

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Product Visualize empowers sellers to showcase and customize products in their actual 
environment, helping create a shared understanding between buyer and seller to accelerate complex sales processes. In industries 
like manufacturing, healthcare, and automotive where products are often complex, and highly configurable or simply too cumbersome 
to carry around, the need for product visualization is key. It builds a buyerâ€™s confidence early in the sales process so costly 
change orders are reduced, and customer satisfaction is higher. 

Using Product Visualize, sellers can show products to customers 
directly within their Dynamics 365 for Sales workflow and spatial and configuration notes are all saved directly within the associated 
sales opportunity. Since sales commonly requires more than just one individual, sellers can leverage session content directly in 
Microsoft Teams to improve internal collaboration to deliver customer-oriented solutions that are critical to accelerating the 
sales process.
