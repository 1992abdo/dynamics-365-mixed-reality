Dynamics 365 Product Visualize empowers sellers to showcase and customize products in a real-world environment. This helps create a shared understanding between buyer and seller to accelerate complex sales processes. In industries like manufacturing, healthcare, and automotive, where products are often complex and highly configurable or simply too cumbersome to carry around, product visualization is key. It builds a buyer's confidence early in the sales process, so costly change orders are reduced, and customer satisfaction is higher.

Spatial and configuration notes are all saved directly within the associated mixed reality session. Because sales tasks commonly involve more than just one individual, sellers can leverage session content directly in Microsoft Teams to improve internal collaboration and deliver customer-oriented solutions that are critical to accelerating the sales process.
