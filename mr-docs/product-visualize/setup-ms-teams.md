## Post notes from Dynamics 365 Product Visualize

Dynamics 365 Product Visualize makes your customers' needs part of the conversation by posting any notes you make in the app back to a connected Teams channel. The text and mixed-reality image get posted to Teams, giving your team the information and context they need to make smart decisions. This feature is enabled by default, but can be turned off through the in-app **Settings** menu.

## What's next?

You now have everything you need to start using Dynamics 365 Product Visualize. New mixed-reality sessions, products, and models will show up automatically in the application after they've been added to Sales. For help or feedback, use the **Feedback** button in the Dynamics 365 Product Visualize app.
