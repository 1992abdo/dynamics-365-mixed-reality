# Dynamics 365 Layout FAQ

Here are answers to common questions about using Microsoft Dynamics 365 Layout.

If you’re an IT admin, learn how to buy and deploy the app. 

**Can I try the app before buying it?**

Yes, Layout is available as a free 30-day trial. For more information, see Buy
and deploy Remote Assist.

**Can I still use the preview app?**

The preview period has ended. Existing preview apps customers have until
December 1, 2018 to upgrade to a paid subscription.

**Do I need the Layout apps for both HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality?**

No, you can use each app separately, though they do work together as well. If
you want to copy 3D models or layouts from your PC to your HoloLens or to
Windows Mixed Reality, you’ll need the Microsoft Dynamics Import Tool (Preview).

-   HoloLens: Your headset must be running the [Windows 10 April 2018

-   Windows Mixed Reality: Your PC must be running the [Windows 10 April 2018

    app with your immersive headset.

Learn more about device options and technical requirements.

Yes, if you’re the admin, you’ll need an Azure AD account to distribute the
apps, and users of Layout and the Import Tool will need an Azure AD account to
sign in to the apps.

If you want to convert 3D models using the Import Tool, you’ll need a Wi-Fi
connection if you use the cloud service option. If you choose to convert files
using the PC option, you don’t need a Wi-Fi connection.

Yes, you can choose between U.S. and metric units from **Settings** \>
**Measurements** \> **Unit of measure**.

At this time, Layout, the Import Tool, and the Visio Add-in for Layout are
available only in English. Additionally, to install the Add-in, you’ll need to
[set the display language for Microsoft Office to
English](https://support.office.com/article/add-an-editing-language-or-set-language-preferences-in-office-663d9d94-ca99-4a0d-973e-7c4a6b8a827d).

By default, the Import Tool uses the Microsoft cloud service to process your
models. If you don’t want your models processed in the cloud, you can use the PC
option. *Learn more*

**How do I import AutoCAD models?**

Currently DWG files are not supported. To import an AutoCAD file, export the
model as FBX from AutoCAD, and then define the textures in Blender or 3DS Max.
Export again as FBX and use the Import Tool cloud option.
