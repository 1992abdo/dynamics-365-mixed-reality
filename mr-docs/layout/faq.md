# Dynamics 365 Layout FAQ

Here are answers to common questions about using Microsoft Dynamics 365 Layout.

**How can I get Layout?**  

If you’re an IT admin, [learn how to try or buy, and deploy the app](../licensing/buy-and-deploy.md).  

**Can I try the app before buying it?**

Yes, Layout is available as a free 30-day trial. For more information, see [Try or buy,
and deploy Layout](../licensing/buy-and-deploy.md).

**Can I still use the preview app?**

The preview period has ended. Existing preview apps customers have until
December 31, 2018, to upgrade to a paid subscription.

**How can I tell which version I'm using?**

To see the version number for Layout, go to **Settings** > **About**.

To see the version number for the Import Tool, go to **Settings**, and then look in the **About** section.

**Do I need the Layout apps for both HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality?**

No, you can use each app separately, though they do work together as well. If
you want to copy 3D models or layouts from your PC to your HoloLens or to
Windows Mixed Reality, you’ll need the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Import Tool (Preview).

**What are the technical requirements for running the Layout apps?**

-   HoloLens: Your headset must be running the [Windows 10 April 2018
    Update](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12643). 

-   Windows Mixed Reality: Your PC must be running the [Windows 10 April 2018
    Update](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028685). You’ll also need
    [Windows Mixed Reality motion
    controllers](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4040517) to use the
    app with your immersive headset.

-   Import Tool: Your PC must be running the [Windows 10 April 2018

**Do I need an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account to use Layout?**

Yes, if you’re the admin, you’ll need an Azure AD account to distribute the
apps, and users of Layout and the Import Tool will need an Azure AD account to
sign in to the apps.

**How often is Layout updated?**

Layout will follow the Modern Lifecyle Policy with continuous service updates and major updates every 6 months (October/April). 

**Can I use the HoloLens clicker with Layout?**

You can use the HoloLens clicker with Layout but it has limited functionality. You can use the clicker to do menu selections and to scan a room, but you can't use it to manipulate objects.

**Do I need to be connected to Wi-Fi to use Layout?**

If you want to convert 3D models using the Import Tool, you’ll need a Wi-Fi
connection if you use the cloud service option. If you choose to convert files
using the PC option, you don’t need a Wi-Fi connection.

**Can I change the unit of measure in the Layout app to metric?**

Yes, you can choose between U.S. and metric units from **Settings** \>
**Measurements** \> **Unit of measure**.

**What languages is Layout available in?**

At this time, Layout, the Import Tool, and the Visio Add-in for Layout are
available only in English. Additionally, to install the Add-in, you’ll need to
[set the display language for Microsoft Office to
English](https://support.office.com/article/add-an-editing-language-or-set-language-preferences-in-office-663d9d94-ca99-4a0d-973e-7c4a6b8a827d).

**Where is Layout available?**

Layout is available worldwide. Layout can be used with HoloLens or a Mixed Reality headset/motion controller and a Windows Ultra PC.

Microsoft HoloLens devices are available in the following markets (English only):

Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States

**How does the Import Tool process my 3D models?**

By default, the Import Tool uses the Microsoft cloud service to process your
models. If you don’t want your models processed in the cloud, you can use the PC
option. [Learn more.](user-guide.md#file-types-and-guidelines)

**How do I import AutoCAD models?**

Currently DWG files are not supported. To import an AutoCAD file, export the
model as FBX from AutoCAD, and then define the textures in Blender or 3DS Max.
Export again as FBX and use the Import Tool cloud option.
