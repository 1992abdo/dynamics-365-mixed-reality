Use Layout
==========

To use Layout, you create space layouts on your HoloLens or PC, and then use a
HoloLens or Windows Mixed Reality immersive headset to place 3D models in the
layouts. The Layout app comes with a set of preinstalled models, and you can
also add your own.

Create a layout
---------------

There are two ways to create a layout:

-   Use [Microsoft Visio](https://products.office.com/en-us/visio/) to design a
    floor plan, and then export it to HoloLens or Windows Mixed Reality.

-   Use Layout on your HoloLens to scan a space.

### Create a layout with Microsoft Visio<br>

**Step 1: Download and install the Visio Add-in for Microsoft Dynamics 365
Layout**

1.  Open the Import Tool.

2.  Select **About**, and then select the 32-bit or the 64-bit download (choose
    the one that matches your version of Visio).

3.  Open Visio, and then select **File** \> **Options **\> **Add-ins**.

4.  Next to **Manage**, select **COM Add-ins**, and then select **Go**.

5.  Select **Visio Add-in for Dynamics 365 Layout**, and then select **Add**.

**Step 2: Create your floor plan with Microsoft Visio**

-   When the floor plan is ready, select the **Layout** tab, select **Export**,
    and then save your floor plan.

**Step 3: Import your floor plan using the Import Tool**

1.  In the Import Tool, select **This PC** \> **Add layout**, and then navigate
    to the floor plan.

2.  Select the floor plan, and then select **Open**.

The floor plan will show up automatically in Layout on a mixed reality immersive
headset connected to the same PC.

To use the layout on HoloLens, you’ll need to move it there:

1.  Connect your HoloLens to your PC using the USB cable.

2.  Open the Import Tool on the PC, and then select **This PC** \> **Layouts**.

3.  Select the check box on the layouts you want to copy, and then select
    **Send**.

4.  On HoloLens, open the Layout app. You’ll find your layout on the **Layouts**
    tab.

### Create a layout with HoloLens

1.  On your HoloLens, open the Layout app.

2.  Select **New layout**, and then follow the instructions for scanning your
    space and creating a layout.

To move the layout to your PC so you can open it on a mixed reality immersive
headset: 

1.  Connect the HoloLens to the PC using the USB cable.

2.  Open the Import Tool, and then select the HoloLens name.

3.  Select the check box on the layout you want to send to your PC, and then
    select **Send**.

Convert 3D models for use on HoloLens or Windows Mixed Reality headsets
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To use 3D models on HoloLens or your immersive headset, you’ll need to convert
them to the correct file format using the Import Tool, and then move them to the
device you want to use them on.

1.  On your PC, open the Import Tool.

2.  Select **Models** \> **This PC**, and then select **Add models**.

3.  If this is the first time you’ve used the Import Tool, choose how you want
    to simplify your models (you can change this later in the app settings):

    -   To use the Microsoft cloud service, select **Use the cloud**. (You'll
        need an internet connection for this option.)

    -   To use your PC, select **Use my PC**. (With this option, there are
        limits on the file types you can import.)

4.  Navigate to the folder where your models are saved, and then select the
    models you want to add (up to 25 at a time).

5.  Select **Open** to start simplifying your models. This might take a while,
    depending on how many you've selected.

If you're using a Windows Mixed Reality immersive headset, your imported models
will show up automatically in Layout.

To use your models on HoloLens, you’ll need to copy them to the device:

1.  On your PC, open the Import Tool.

2.  Connect your HoloLens to the PC, and then sign in to the HoloLens.

3.  In the Import Tool, select **This PC** \> **Models**, and then select the
    check boxes on the models you want to send to HoloLens.

4.  Select **Send**.

### File types and guidelines

There are different limits on the types of files you can import, depending on
whether you use the cloud or your PC to convert the files. Using the cloud
service simplifies the conversion process. If you use the PC option, you’ll need
to adhere to a number of prerequisites.

**For the cloud service**

| **File format** | FBX (version 7.5 or earlier) |
|-----------------|------------------------------|


-   OBJ

    -   SKP (version 6 or earlier)

        -   JT (versions 8 and 9)

            -   STP, STEP (versions AP203 and AP214)

            -   GLTF, GLB

                -   Version 2.0

                -   Extensions: KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness, MSFT_lod,
                    MSFT_packing_occlusionRoughnessMetallic,
                    MSFT_packing_normalRoughnessMetallic, MSFT_texture_dds

| **External files**     | If your model references external files, such as the following, you'll need to create a ZIP file containing the model and the files it references to import the model: |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Textures**           | Textures are unembedded. Zip your file with the unembedded textures. You can only zip one model at a time with its textures.                                           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| **Model orientation**  | Floor-associated objects: the model’s +Y axis should point up and the +Z axis should point forward.                                                                    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

-   Textures (PNG, TGA, etc.)

-   Materials (MTL)

-   Other parts

The ZIP file should only contain the above file formats and their dependent
external files.

-   Ceiling-associated objects: the model’s +Y axis should point down and the +Z
    axis should point forward.

-   Wall-associated objects: the model’s +Y axis should point away from the wall
    and the +Z axis should point up the wall.

 

See the next section in this topic to learn how the cloud service works.

**For the PC**

| **File format** | GLB file formats only, with the following limitations: |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|


-   No more than 1 material per mesh

    -   No more than 1 set of UVs per mesh

        -   No more than 2 meshes

            -   No more than 10,000 total polygons (triangles). Less than 5,000
                is recommended.

            -   Maximum texture size of 2048 x 2048 (512 x 512 recommended)

| **Textures**          | Textures are embedded. Export your model from your CAD program as a single self-contained file.     |   |   |   |   |   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Polycount**         | Less than 10,000 polygons per model                                                                 |   |   |   |   |   |
| **Mesh**              | Export your model as \<=2 meshes with 1 material per mesh                                           |   |   |   |   |   |
| **Model orientation** | Floor-associated objects: the model’s +Y axis should point up and the +Z axis should point forward. |   |   |   |   |   |

>   **Note:** Emissive, occlusion, specular, and gloss textures will be ignored.

-   Ceiling-associated objects: the model’s +Y axis should point down and the +Z
    axis should point forward.

-   Wall-associated objects: the model’s +Y axis should point away from the wall
    and the +Z axis should point up the wall.

Best practices for importing 3D models 
---------------------------------------

-   When you’re creating a 3D model using 3D creation tools, make sure that the
    model is not too far off from the center (the origin of the grid).

-   When exporting from 3D creation tools, if available, choose the “embed
    texture option” in FBX export. If not available, include the FBX file and
    any image files in a ZIP archive and use the resulting ZIP as your import
    file.

The Import Tool is designed to import 3D models that can be individually used in
any spatial design layout. It is not optimized for importing intact scenes or
layouts (complete buildings files with multiple models already positioned). Also
note that:

-   Models with interiors will not be preserved.

-   Existing offsets in models, any transforms off the 3D origin (0,0,0), or
    relative offsets from other models will be preserved on export and
    subsequent import.

-   Any usage of layers for grouping or defining model colors will not be
    preserved.

-   Any use of “hatching” in AutoCAD will not be preserved.

-   Imported models that are comprised of multiple individual sub-objects will
    result in a single combined mesh to enable more efficient interaction with
    the complete model.

How does the Microsoft cloud service work?
------------------------------------------

When you convert a 3D model, the Import Tool uploads the raw model to
the Microsoft cloud service, which is hosted on a Microsoft Azure web service.
The cloud service transcodes and simplifies the model and then returns the
simplified models to the Import Tool, restricting access via the use of
obfuscated URLs.

-   Both the raw model and the simplified model are transferred by using the
    HTTPS protocol.

-   Both the raw model and the simplified model are hosted on Azure Blob
    storage.

-   Both the raw model and the simplified model are purged from Azure Blob
    storage after 24 hours.

-   The simplified model is fetched via an obfuscated URL by using the HTTPS
    protocol.
