## Install the apps

How you install [!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)] and the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)] depends on how your administrator
chooses to distribute the apps. Your admin may have you install the app from the
Microsoft Store for Consumers, from your organization’s private store, through
an email link, or another method. 

The following table describes the app/tool, and how to install them from the
public store.

| **App**     | **Device**            | **Use to**                            | **To install from Microsoft store** |

## Use Layout

To use [!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)], you create space layouts on your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] or PC, and then use a
[!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] or Windows Mixed Reality immersive headset to place 3D models in the
layouts. The [!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)] app comes with a set of preinstalled models, and you can
also add your own.

### Create a layout

There are two ways to create a layout:

-   Use [Microsoft Visio](https://products.office.com/en-us/visio/) to design a
    floor plan, and then export it to [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] or Windows Mixed Reality.

-   Use [!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)] on your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] to scan a space.

#### Create a layout with Microsoft Visio<br>

**Step 1: Download and install the [!include[pn-visio](../includes/pn-visio.md)] Add-in for Microsoft [!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)]**

1.  Open the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)].

2.  Select **About**, and then select the 32-bit or the 64-bit download (choose
    the one that matches your version of [!include[pn-visio](../includes/pn-visio.md)]).
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Download Visio add-in](media/1-visio-download-page.png "Download Visio add-in") 

3.  Open [!include[pn-visio](../includes/pn-visio.md)], and then select **File** \> **Options** \> **Add-ins**.

4.  Next to **Manage**, select **COM Add-ins**, and then select **Go**.

5.  Select **[!include[pn-visio](../includes/pn-visio.md)] Add-in for [!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)]**, and then select **Add**.

**Step 2: Create your floor plan with Microsoft [!include[pn-visio](../includes/pn-visio.md)]**

-   When the floor plan is ready, select the **[!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)]** tab, select **Export**,
    and then save your floor plan.

**Step 3: Import your floor plan using the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)]**

1.  In the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)], select **This PC** \> **Add layout**, and then navigate
    to the floor plan.

2.  Select the floor plan, and then select **Open**.

    The floor plan will show up automatically in [!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)] on a mixed reality immersive
headset connected to the same PC.

To use the layout on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], you’ll need to move it there:

1.  Connect your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] to your PC using the USB cable.

2.  Open the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)] on the PC, and then select **This PC** \> **Layouts**.

3.  Select the check box on the layouts you want to copy, and then select
    **Send**.
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Move layout to HoloLens](media/2-selected-layouts-send-to-hololens.png "Move layout to HoloLens")

4.  On [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], open the [!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)] app. You’ll find your layout on the **Layouts**
    tab.

#### Create a layout with HoloLens

1.  On your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], open the [!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)] app.

2.  Select **New layout**, and then follow the instructions for scanning your
    space and creating a layout.

To move the layout to your PC so you can open it on a mixed reality immersive
headset: 

1.  Connect the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] to the PC using the USB cable.

2.  Open the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)], and then select the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] name.

3.  Select the check box on the layout you want to send to your PC, and then
    select **Send**.

## Convert 3D models for use on HoloLens or Windows Mixed Reality headsets

To use 3D models on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] or your immersive headset, you’ll need to convert
them to the correct file format using the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)], and then move them to the
device you want to use them on.

1.  On your PC, open the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)].

2.  Select **Models** \> **This PC**, and then select **Add models**.

3.  If this is the first time you’ve used the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)], choose how you want
    to simplify your models (you can change this later in the app settings):

    -   To use the Microsoft cloud service, select **Use the cloud**. (You'll
        need an internet connection for this option.)

    -   To use your PC, select **Use my PC**. (With this option, there are
        [limits on the file types](#file-types-and-guidelines) you can import.)
        
        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        > ![Cloud or PC option](media/cloud-pc-option.PNG "Cloud or PC option")

4.  Navigate to the folder where your models are saved, and then select the
    models you want to add (up to 25 at a time).

5.  Select **Open** to start simplifying your models. This might take a while,
    depending on how many you've selected.

If you're using a Windows Mixed Reality immersive headset, your imported models
will show up automatically in [!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)].

To use your models on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], you’ll need to copy them to the device:

1.  On your PC, open the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)].

2.  Connect your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] to the PC, and then sign in to the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)].

3.  In the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)], select **This PC** \> **Models**, and then select the
    check boxes on the models you want to send to [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)].
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Copy models to HoloLens](media/5-copy-models-to-hololens.png "Copy models to HoloLens")

4.  Select **Send**.

### File types and guidelines

There are different limits on the types of files you can import, depending on
whether you use the cloud or your PC to convert the files. Using the cloud
service simplifies the conversion process. If you use the PC option, you’ll need
to adhere to a number of prerequisites.

#### For the cloud service

|  Item           |     Description                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| **File format** | <ul><li>FBX (version 7.5 or earlier) </li><li>OBJ </li><li>SKP (version 18 or earlier) </li><li>JT (versions 8 and 9) </li><li>STP, STEP (versions AP203 and AP214) </li><li>GLTF, GLB </li><ul><li>Version 2.0 </li><li>Supported extensions:<ul><li>Input:<ul><li>MSFT_texture_dds</li><li>KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness</li></ul><li>Output<ul><li> MSFT_packing_occlusionRoughnessMetallic </li><li>MSFT_packing_normalRoughnessMetallic</li><li>MSFT_texture_dds (supported but not used)</ul></ul></ul><li>ZIP</li> |
| **External files**     | If your model references external files, such as the following, you'll need to create a ZIP file containing the model and the files it references to import the model:<br> <ul><li>Textures (PNG, TGA, etc.) </li><li>Materials (MTL) </li><li>Other parts </li></ul> The ZIP file should only contain the above file formats and their dependent external files.   |   
| **Textures**   | Textures are unembedded. Zip your file with the unembedded textures. You can only zip one model at a time with its textures.           |   
| **Model orientation**  | <ul><li>Floor-associated objects: the model’s +Y axis should point up and the +Z axis should point forward. </li><li>Ceiling-associated objects: the model’s +Y axis should point down and the +Z axis should point forward. </li><li>Wall-associated objects: the model’s +Y axis should point away from the wall and the +Z axis should point up the wall.</li></ul> |   

See the next section in this topic to learn how the cloud service works.

#### For the PC

|  Item           |     Description                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| **File format** | GLB file formats only, with the following recommendations: <ul><li>No more than 1 set of UVs per mesh</li><li>Less than 5,000 polygons</li><li>Texture size of 512 x 512 </li></ul> |
| **Textures**     | Textures are embedded. Export your model from your CAD program as a single self-contained file. <br> **Note:** Emissive, occlusion, specular, and gloss textures will be ignored.    | 
| **Model orientation** | <ul><li>Floor-associated objects: the model’s +Y axis should point up and the +Z axis should point forward.</li><li>Ceiling-associated objects: the model’s +Y axis should point down and the +Z axis should point forward. </li><li>Wall-associated objects: the model’s +Y axis should point away from the wall and the +Z axis should point up the wall.</ul> |  

## Best practices for importing 3D models 

-   When you’re creating a 3D model using 3D creation tools, make sure that the
    model is not too far off from the center (the origin of the grid).

-   When exporting from 3D creation tools, if available, choose the “embed
    texture option” in FBX export. If not available, include the FBX file and
    any image files in a ZIP archive and use the resulting ZIP as your import
    file.

The [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)] is designed to import 3D models that can be individually used in
any spatial design layout. It is not optimized for importing intact scenes or
layouts (complete buildings files with multiple models already positioned). Also
note that:

-   Models with interiors will not be preserved.

-   Existing offsets in models, any transforms off the 3D origin (0,0,0), or
    relative offsets from other models will be preserved on export and
    subsequent import.

-   Any usage of layers for grouping or defining model colors will not be
    preserved.

-   Any use of “hatching” in AutoCAD will not be preserved.

-   Imported models that are comprised of multiple individual sub-objects will
    result in a single combined mesh to enable more efficient interaction with
    the complete model.

## How does the Microsoft cloud service work?

When you convert a 3D model, the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)] uploads the raw model to
the Microsoft cloud service, which is hosted on a Microsoft [!include[pn-azure](../includes/pn-azure.md)] web service.
The cloud service transcodes and simplifies the model and then returns the
simplified models to the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)], restricting access via the use of
obfuscated URLs.

-   Both the raw model and the simplified model are transferred by using the
    HTTPS protocol.

-   Both the raw model and the simplified model are hosted on [!include[pn-azure](../includes/pn-azure.md)] Blob
    storage.

-   Both the raw model and the simplified model are purged from [!include[pn-azure](../includes/pn-azure.md)] Blob
    storage after 24 hours.

-   The simplified model is fetched via an obfuscated URL by using the HTTPS
    protocol.

## Work with models

On [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] and in Windows Mixed Reality, you can place, move, copy, resize, and
rotate 3D models.

## Improve perfomance when your assets don't require texture or multiple colors

In certain scenarios, textures or multiple colors might not be important for visualizing 3D assets. In these cases, to improve 
performance, you might want to turn off textures and use a single color. You can do this by using the Performance setting. 

To turn the Performance setting on or off:

- Select **Settings**, select **Performance**, and then select the **Simplify objects by using just one color** option.
