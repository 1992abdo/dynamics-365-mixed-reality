## Use Layout

To use [!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)], you create space layouts on your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] or PC, and then use a
[!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] or [!include[pn-ms-windows-short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] Mixed Reality immersive headset to place 3D models in the
layouts. The [!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)] app comes with a set of preinstalled models, and you can
also add your own.

### Create a layout

There are two ways to create a layout:

-   Use [Microsoft Visio](https://products.office.com/en-us/visio/) to design a
    floor plan, and then export it to [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] or [!include[pn-ms-windows-short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] Mixed Reality.

-   Use [!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)] on your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] to scan a space.

#### Create a layout with Microsoft Visio<br>

**Step 1: Download and install the [!include[pn-visio](../includes/pn-visio.md)] Add-in for [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)]**

1.  Open the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)].

2.  Select **About**, and then select the 32-bit or the 64-bit download (choose
    the one that matches your version of [!include[pn-visio](../includes/pn-visio.md)]).
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Download Visio add-in](media/1-visio-download-page.png "Download Visio add-in") 

3.  Open [!include[pn-visio](../includes/pn-visio.md)], and then select **File** \> **Options** \> **Add-ins**.

4.  Next to **Manage**, select **COM Add-ins**, and then select **Go**.

5.  Select **[!include[pn-visio](../includes/pn-visio.md)] Add-in for [!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)]**, and then select **Add**.

**Step 2: Create your floor plan with [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-visio](../includes/pn-visio.md)]**

-   When the floor plan is ready, select the **[!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)]** tab, select **Export**,
    and then save your floor plan.

**Step 3: Import your floor plan using the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)]**

1.  In the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)], select **This PC** \> **Add layout**, and then navigate
    to the floor plan.

2.  Select the floor plan, and then select **Open**.

    The floor plan will show up automatically in [!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)] on a mixed reality immersive
headset connected to the same PC.

To use the layout on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], you’ll need to move it there:

1.  Connect your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] to your PC using the USB cable.

2.  Open the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)] on the PC, and then select **This PC** \> **Layouts**.

3.  Select the check box on the layouts you want to copy, and then select
    **Send**.
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Move layout to HoloLens](media/2-selected-layouts-send-to-hololens.png "Move layout to HoloLens")

4.  On [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], open the [!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)] app. You’ll find your layout on the **Layouts**
    tab.

#### Create a layout with HoloLens

1.  On your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], open the [!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)] app.

2.  Select **New layout**, and then follow the instructions for scanning your
    space and creating a layout.

To move the layout to your PC so you can open it on a mixed reality immersive
headset: 

1.  Connect the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] to the PC using the USB cable.

2.  Open the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)], and then select the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] name.

3.  Select the check box on the layout you want to send to your PC, and then
    select **Send**.

## Convert 3D models for use on HoloLens or Windows Mixed Reality headsets

To use 3D models on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] or your immersive headset, you’ll need to convert
them to the correct file format using the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)], and then move them to the
device you want to use them on.

The Import Tool provides three options for preparing your 3D models. Use the following table to determine which option is best for your needs.

|**Option**|**Description**|**Supported file formats**|
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
|Optimize using the Microsoft Cloud Service|This is the simplest way to optimize your 3D models. The Microsoft Cloud Service automatically transcodes and simplifies the models you select. You can specify the type of device (HoloLens or Windows Mixed Reality headset) to optimize for, and also the number of models per scene. If you're not happy with the initial results after optimizing, you can use a sliding scale to re-optimize the model, focusing on performance or quality.|FBX, OBJ, SKP, JT, STP, STEP, GLTF, GLB|
|Convert without optimizing|Use this option if you've already optimized a model using an external tool and want to retain the model properties when you convert it for use on HoloLens or Mixed Reality headsets.|GLB only|
|Convert using your PC|Use this option if you want to have more control over the optimization process with no limits on the number of polygons or meshes.|GLB only|

Specific instructions for each option are provided below.

### Optimize using the Microsoft Cloud Service

1.  On your PC, open the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)].

2.  Select **Models** \> **This PC**, and then select **Add models**.

3.  Go to the folder where your models are saved, and then select the
    models you want to import (up to 25 at a time).

4. Select **Open**.

5. Select **Optimize using the Microsoft Cloud Service.**

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Microsoft Cloud Service option](media/cloud-service-option.PNG "Microsoft Cloud Service Option") 

6. Under **Optimization settings**, choose the type of device you're optimizing for (HoloLens or Mixed Reality headsets) and the number of models that you'll use in a single scene. These settings will apply to all models you selected in Step 3.

      > ![Optimization settings](media/optimization-settings.PNG "Optimization settings") 

7. Select **Optimize all models** to start the optimization process. This process might take a while, depending on how many models you're importing.

8. When the optimization process is complete, open each model to view the results. If you aren't happy with the results of any model, do the following:

   1. On the **Properties** tab for the model, select **Optimize again**. 
   
   2. Under **Optimize this model again**, pull the slider to the left to optimize for performance or to the right to optimize for quality. Optimizing for performance will result in a model that performs better on HoloLens or Mixed Reality headsets, but may compromise on visual quality. Optimizing for quality will result in a model that has better visual quality but may adversely affect device performance, resulting in user discomfort.
   
      > ![Re-optimization slider](media/reoptimize-slider.PNG "Re-optimization slider") 
   
   3. Once you've moved the slider to the desired level, select **Optimize**.
         
   4. Repeat steps a, b and c until you're satisfied with the results.
   
      > [!NOTE]
      > The re-optimization option is available for 24 hours after the first optimization done using the cloud service.

If you're using a [!include[pn-ms-windows-short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] Mixed Reality immersive headset, your imported models will show up automatically in [!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)].
	
To use your models on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], you’ll need to copy them to the device as described below. 

### Convert without optimizing

1.  On your PC, open the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)].

2.  Select **Models** \> **This PC**, and then select **Add models**.

3.  Go to the folder where your models are saved, and then select the
    models you want to import (up to 25 at a time).

4. Select **Open**.

5. Select **Convert without optimizing**.

   > ![Convert without optimizing option](media/convert-without-optimizing.PNG "Convert without optimizing option") 

6. Select **Optimize all models** to start the optimization process. This process might take a while, depending on how many models you're importing.

If you're using a [!include[pn-ms-windows-short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] Mixed Reality immersive headset, your imported models will show up automatically in [!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)].
	
To use your models on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], you’ll need to copy them to the device as described below.

### Convert using your PC

1.  On your PC, open the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)].

2.  Select **Models** \> **This PC**, and then select **Add models**.

3.  Go to the folder where your models are saved, and then select the
    models you want to import (up to 25 at a time).

4. Select **Open**.

5. Select **Convert using this PC**. 

   > ![Convert with PC option](media/convert-with-PC.PNG "Convert with PC option")
      
   > [!NOTE] 
   > The **Convert using this PC** option will not be available if any of your source models are not in GLB file format. For more information on file type limitations, see **File types and guidelines** below.  
   
6. Select **Optimize all models** to start the optimization process. The optimization process might take a while, depending on how many models you're importing.

If you're using a [!include[pn-ms-windows-short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] Mixed Reality immersive headset, your imported models will show up automatically in [!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)].
	
To use your models on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], you’ll need to copy them to the device as described below.

### Copy models to a HoloLens device

To use optimized/converted models on a [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], you need to copy them to the device first.

1. On your PC, open the Import Tool.
2. Connect your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] to the PC, and then sign in to the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)].
3. In the Import Tool, select **This PC > Models**, and then select the check boxes for the models you want to send to [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)].
4. Select **Send**.

### Provide feedback and submit assets for manual processing if the quality is unsatisfactory

You can provide feedback on the quality of prepared 3D models and get assistance from Microsoft if you're not satisfied with the quality.

1. Select the **Models** or **All** tab, and then select the model you want to provide feedback on.
2. At the bottom of the **Properties** tab, under **How does the model look?**, select **Looks good** or **Looks broken** to record your feedback.

> ![Provide feedback](media/feedback.PNG "Provide feedback")

> [!NOTE]
> You can't update feedback after you submit it. 
	
If you rate the quality at 3 or below (out of 5), you'll be prompted to optionally submit the model to Microsoft for manual optimization. To submit a model for manual optimization: 

1. Review the terms and conditions, and then if you consent, select the check box.
2. Select **Next**.
3. Enter the location of the source file, why you're dissatisfied with the results, and your email address.
4. Select **Next** to upload the file to Microsoft safely and securely.
   You'll receive an acknowledgement confirming receipt of the model (and will also receive an email confirmation). 

Microsoft will update you on the progress of the manual optimization through email and will let you know when the model is ready to use.

To download a model after manual optimization: 

1. Open the Import Tool.

2. Right-click the model that was submitted for manual processing. 

   > ![Select model](media/select-model.PNG "Select model")
   
3. Select **Download from Microsoft**.

   > ![Download model](media/download-model.PNG "Download model")
   
   The manually optimized model will replace the previous model in the Import Tool.


### File types and guidelines

There are different limits on the types of files you can import, depending on
whether you use the cloud or your PC to convert the files. Using the cloud
service simplifies the conversion process. If you use the PC option, you’ll need
to adhere to a number of prerequisites.

#### For the cloud service

|  Item           |     Description                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| **File format** | <ul><li>FBX (version 7.5 or earlier) </li><li>OBJ </li><li>SKP (version 18 or earlier) </li><li>JT (versions 8 and 9) </li><li>STP, STEP (versions AP203 and AP214) </li><li>GLTF, GLB </li><ul><li>Version 2.0 </li><li>Supported extensions:<ul><li>Input:<ul><li>MSFT_texture_dds</li><li>KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness</li></ul><li>Output<ul><li> MSFT_packing_occlusionRoughnessMetallic </li><li>MSFT_packing_normalRoughnessMetallic</li><li>MSFT_texture_dds (supported but not used)</ul></ul></ul><li>ZIP</li> |
| **External files**     | If your model references external files, such as the following, you'll need to create a ZIP file containing the model and the files it references to import the model:<br> <ul><li>Textures (PNG, TGA, etc.) </li><li>Materials (MTL) </li><li>Other parts </li></ul> The ZIP file should only contain the above file formats and their dependent external files.   |   
| **Textures**   | Textures are unembedded. Zip your file with the unembedded textures. You can only zip one model at a time with its textures.           |   
| **Model orientation**  | <ul><li>Floor-associated objects: the model’s +Y axis should point up and the +Z axis should point forward. </li><li>Ceiling-associated objects: the model’s +Y axis should point down and the +Z axis should point forward. </li><li>Wall-associated objects: the model’s +Y axis should point away from the wall and the +Z axis should point up the wall.</li></ul> |   

See the next section in this topic to learn how the cloud service works.

#### For the PC

|  Item           |     Description                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| **File format** | GLB file formats only, with the following recommendations: <ul><li>No more than 1 set of UVs per mesh</li><li>Less than 5,000 polygons</li><li>Texture size of 512 x 512 </li></ul> |
| **Textures**     | Textures are embedded. Export your model from your CAD program as a single self-contained file. <br> **Note:** Emissive, occlusion, specular, and gloss textures will be ignored.    | 
| **Model orientation** | <ul><li>Floor-associated objects: the model’s +Y axis should point up and the +Z axis should point forward.</li><li>Ceiling-associated objects: the model’s +Y axis should point down and the +Z axis should point forward. </li><li>Wall-associated objects: the model’s +Y axis should point away from the wall and the +Z axis should point up the wall.</ul> |  

## Best practices for importing 3D models 

-   When you’re creating a 3D model using 3D creation tools, make sure that the
    model is not too far off from the center (the origin of the grid).

-   When exporting from 3D creation tools, if available, choose the “embed
    texture option” in FBX export. If not available, include the FBX file and
    any image files in a ZIP archive and use the resulting ZIP as your import
    file.

The [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)] is designed to import 3D models that can be individually used in
any spatial design layout. It is not optimized for importing intact scenes or
layouts (complete buildings files with multiple models already positioned). Also
note that:

-   Models with interiors will not be preserved.

-   Existing offsets in models, any transforms off the 3D origin (0,0,0), or
    relative offsets from other models will be preserved on export and
    subsequent import.

-   Any usage of layers for grouping or defining model colors will not be
    preserved.

-   Any use of “hatching” in AutoCAD will not be preserved.

-   Imported models that are comprised of multiple individual sub-objects will
    result in a single combined mesh to enable more efficient interaction with
    the complete model.

## How does the Microsoft cloud service work?

When you convert a 3D model, the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)] uploads the raw model to
the [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] cloud service, which is hosted on a [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-azure](../includes/pn-azure.md)] web service.
The cloud service transcodes and simplifies the model and then returns the
simplified models to the [!include[pn-import-tool](../includes/pn-import-tool.md)], restricting access via the use of
obfuscated URLs.

-   Both the raw model and the simplified model are transferred by using the
    HTTPS protocol.

-   Both the raw model and the simplified model are hosted on [!include[pn-azure](../includes/pn-azure.md)] Blob
    storage.

-   Both the raw model and the simplified model are purged from [!include[pn-azure](../includes/pn-azure.md)] Blob
    storage after 24 hours.

-   The simplified model is fetched via an obfuscated URL by using the HTTPS
    protocol.

## Work with models

On [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] and in [!include[pn-ms-windows-short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] Mixed Reality, you can place, move, copy, resize, and
rotate 3D models.

## Improve perfomance when your assets don't require texture or multiple colors

In certain scenarios, textures or multiple colors might not be important for visualizing 3D assets. In these cases, to improve 
performance, you might want to turn off textures and use a single color. You can do this by using the Performance setting. 

To turn the Performance setting on or off:

- Select **Settings**, select **Performance**, and then select the **Simplify objects by using just one color** option.
