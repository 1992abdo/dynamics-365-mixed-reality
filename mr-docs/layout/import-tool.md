# Use the Dynamics 365 Import Tool to import 3D (CAD) models and copy layouts


You can use the [!include[pn-dyn-365-import-tool](../includes/pn-dyn-365-import-tool.md)] to import 3D (CAD) models for use with the [!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)] [!include[pn-HoloLens](../includes/pn-HoloLens.md)] app or the [!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)] 
immersive headset app. You can also use the [!include[pn-dyn-365-import-tool](../includes/pn-dyn-365-import-tool.md)] to move layouts created with the [!include[pn-HoloLens](../includes/pn-HoloLens.md)] app to use with immersive headsets, 
or vice versa. For information on using the [!include[pn-dyn-365-import-tool](../includes/pn-dyn-365-import-tool.md)] with [!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)], see the 
[Import Tool overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/mixed-reality/import-tool).

The [!include[pn-dyn-365-import-tool](../includes/pn-dyn-365-import-tool.md)] is included with your [!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)] subscription. You can also try out either app for free for up to 90 days. For more information on the free trial, see:
