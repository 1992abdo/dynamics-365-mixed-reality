# Work offline in Operator mode in Dynamics 365 Guides

If you're working in an environment, such as a factory floor or on a field service call, where you have internet access or internet 
access is intermittent, you can continue to work offline with a guide that you're currently working with. You don't need to do anything 
to set up **Offline** mode. When you open a guide while you're connected to the internet, the guide is automatically downloaded for 
offline use.

Any guide that's available for offline use will show up under the **All** tab. If no guides are available offline, you'll see this message: 

"No guides are available offline."

### How do I sign in to a guide when offline?

you must connect to the internet to sign back in. If you see the **Offline** banner when you try to sign in, you won't be able to sign in until you 
reconnect to the internet.
